       <h1 data-trilium-h1>The Tale of the Three Sisters</h1>

      <div class="ck-content">
        <p>Once upon a time in the ancinent time of old when the world was young
          during the days of thunder in Toril there was three sisters. All three
          were arch feys and lived in harmony together as a family. One day when
          the Seelie and Unseelie courts came to be, a dispute among them would shatter
          the once happy family apart. This was due to a few reasons without going
          into any detail. One was falling in love with a prominent member of the
          Unseelie Court. One jealous being in love with the same person as her sister
          and sided against her while the third were ambitious and sought to part
          from the Fey all together to strive for her own goals and achievements.
          Their names were Morveen, Nicnevin and the third we all know this day as
          Baba Yaga.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>As conflict in the feywild rose so did the conflict with the sisters rise
          as eventually they went seperate ways. Morween lost her beloved during
          the conflict and stay with the courts while Nicnevin cursed the sisters
          and tried to steal the powers of Baba Yaga. The two thought with Nicnevin
          loosing and being bansihed from the courts to never return ever while Baba
          Yaga went to material plane and with some power taken from Nicnevin formed
          her own coven creating the first hags. Morween remained with the courts
          and thus the three sisters were seperated.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Baba Yaga spread her coven of hags over Toril and eventully became the
          ruler of the sixth hell Melbolge for a time before Glasya thwarted her
          and cast her out with the devils manipulated and casting her out.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Nicnevin in the feywild remained as an arch fey and eventually became
          the Queen of Witches.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Morween as part of the Unseelie court and the sub part of the shadow court
          can still be visited in the fey wild to this day while Nicnevin is much
          harder to find and probably not the wisest to do with her evil alignment.</p>
