        <p>Ksandra is a kind hearted person. Strict in her handling but as long as
          you follow the rules its fine. Growing up she lived in the Seelie Court.
          Realizing she does not fit well in with the others she went and tried to
          start her own court. Over the time of a 100 years she managed to build
          up a good reputation and became a warlock patreon for a lot of people.
          Growing her power and claiming parts of the Feywilde for herself and people
          that live with her. Creating a city where she rules with her court.</p>
