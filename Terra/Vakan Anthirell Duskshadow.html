        <p>Time...When you are an immortal lich who has lived for longer than they
          can keep track of what does time even mean?. You live through centuries
          and see civilisation rise and fall over and over again. Eventually, you
          become an aimless husk, wondering why you are alive and what point there
          is to life hoping to find meaning in your existes. Such is the case regarding
          Vakan.</p>
        <p><strong>The Beginning</strong>
        </p>
        <p>Vakan's story begins a long long time ago in a different world than normal.
          This is the world of Terra.</p>
        <p>At birth. the young person was born into a farmer family and during his
          childhood, he played with the other kids. He had many siblings as he was
          <br>one among nine children. He had three brothers and five sisters. At a
          young age, he kept mostly to himself but his family quite quickly learned
          that there was something of with him. From a young age the kid had an obsession
          with death. The first incident was when he had his first experience with
          death. There was a baby bird who fell off the tree. Most children would
          feel sad or have a bad feeling. Vakan however saw it and was wondering
          what happened and tried to experiment with the bird. First trying to wake
          it up. Then making an attempt to bring it back to life with normal means.
          When nothing worked he thought maybe something inside the bird was broken.
          However, the child did not know much about medicine and took the bird to
          the temple where people knew more.</p>
        <p>He was then surprised as he got scolded for messing with the bird and
          was told what death was and had it explained to him that the soul left
          the body. His question was simply, "What is a soul?" Which the doctor had
          no response to. During his lecture, he was told that eventually, all living
          things will die. It could be from old age, natural disasters, monsters
          tearing you apart or simple accidents. The doctor then explained that after
          you die your soul lives your body and your body is to be put to rest either
          buried or burned. As the doctor explains the last part he was shown to
          the graveyard which was a mistake.</p>
        <p>The second incident that happened later was young Vakan digging up a grave
          and to his surprise and amazement once more he only found bones and was
          completely stunned. Where was the meat? The skin? All the bits and pieces?"
          Dumbfounded he looked around desperately but found nothing. Shortly after
          his parents came as he was spotted by one of his siblings. Young Vakan
          not knowing any better ran back to his parents and cried. "Somebody has
          stolen the skin, flesh and organs from Miss Alva!" He proclaimed.</p>
        <p>This is when the family saw that the young kid had an obsession. They
          tried to teach him that it was wrong but no matter how many people told
          him he couldn't do something it just made Vakan want to explore more. Eventually,
          they were forced to lock him inside the house. After the incident at the
          graveyard, his siblings started to bully him and harass him as the youngest
          he was an easy target after all.</p>
        <p>Vakan being quite weak rarely thought back. He often just accepted the
          bullies and what they did as part of his childhood. While locked up he
          would often wander around everything and anything that would keep his mind
          of the reality he would delve into. One of these activities was sneaking
          into his parent's books. This would lead him to often get punished and
          locked into the basements with the rats. To Vakan this was not a punishment
          but more of an opportunity as he liked the rats and he often made it so
          he got caught as he snuck food for the rats and befriended them. However,
          the bullies rarely let up and eventually, Vakan's siblings find out about
          his new friends. For the first time, Vakan thought back, defending his
          friends and as the fight happened at the stairs he tripped one of his brothers
          who fell down the stairs and snapped their neck. The other siblings scared
          and shocked headed back to their parents and fled the scene as Vakan fascinated
          moved over to his brother and did what he always does. Examining the cause
          of death just like he did once before with the bird. Before he could cut
          him open though to take a closer look his parents showed up and stopped
          him. Once more he got scolded and got locked up in the closet this time.
          Little did the parents know that the young Vakan after months of being
          locked up learned how to escape. He just learned that instead of looking
          for bodies or waiting for them to show up he can provide with his own.
          As he went to the kitchen and took a knife before he went to his parents
          and.... Well Vakan did what he always wanted and nobody stopped him this
          time. He never learned what he later learned and came to regret this course
          of actions but by that time it was too late.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>It was not only until days later that the guards of Scandia found him
          hungry and alone at the crime scene he caused. They took him into custody
          but what to be done with the child was uncertain. They then decided to
          put him into an orphanage next to a library. Vakan lived there for most
          of his childhood as he stopped his attempts as he knew the answers he was
          looking for were inside people. He looked very closely before now knowing
          that way, wouldn't provide him what he needed. So instead he read and continued
          to do so. As he kept reading and lived in the orphanage every now and then
          they were told to work in the library. On such a visit he read their books
          and often visited the library as he later worked there in his teens.</p>
        <p>One day while working at the library he stumbled on a book about magic
          and took a keen interest in arcana. Quite clever and smart he was a natural
          as he learned magic at a faster rate than most and eventually he found
          the thing he have been looking for his entire life "Necromancy". He contniued
          to study the magic and learned all he could. The only problem is that the
          knowledge of the magic was limited. This did not stop the now teenager
          to learn and practice the magic he got and eventually when he was ready
          he could start for real. Just like his old home he to was bullied here
          at the orphanage. He never did anything about it since he knew he needed
          to be ready for the day he would stop them just like he did before. It
          was just a cantrip, something he mastered after the first 2 years. As a
          kid he learned medicine until he was 12 from when he was 7. He then came
          into the orphanage at 13 and studied magic since he was 14. Now 3 years
          later he has learned quite the bit of magic as he lead the bully into private.
          Thinking the weak Vakan was not going to be an issue was a misstake as
          Vakan unleashed the first cantrip he learned. Chill Touch and sruck the
          bully twice before the Bully could strike him down. Part 1 out of 2 was
          done and the last part would commence. A drop of blood, a piece of flesh
          and a pinch of bone dust. The corpse of a humanoid person not to long gone.
          He then started the process of animating the body back to life. The extent
          of all of his power. From 13 to 14 trying to just grasp the arcane formulas
          and understanding of magic. 14 to 15 learning the basic of cantrips, followed
          by two years of learning and grasping for knowledge of spell magic. Yet
          he was not ready now at the age of 17.</p>
        <p>His mission completed as the zombie awoke but not under his control. The
          undead creature leapt at him and Vakan had to flee. He needed more time.
          Time that he no longer held or had the luxory of as the voices and grunts
          of the zombie faded. The young Vakan looked and saw that the Zombie now
          ran the other way loose in the library.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><strong>The Awakening of a Wizard</strong>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Once more the officials intervened and apprehended Vakan. The zombie claimed
          3 lives before it was put down and Vakan once more was captured. This time
          however one of the people arrested him saw the zombie and the young lad.
          As they questioned him they found out he had no teacher. To cast a third
          level spell at such a young age and with no teacher. It failed but the
          fact that it was partially accomplished is a feat not many could accomplish.
          The official informed the royal academy who then payed for his bail and
          took him to train as they would educate him properly and teach him the
          values and teachings he never received as a kid. Finally Vakan had found
          his home, finally he had found the place where he belonged. Vakan flourished
          at an exceptional rate at the academy and grew up to become an exceptional
          magician. Learning the tough lessons of life of being bullied he never
          lowered his guards and thus used his power to prepare for when people would
          start to act towards him. The teachers praising him and acknowledge his
          talents was not the same as the fellow students who distanced themselves
          from him when they found out that he was a necromancer. He was always nice
          and polite to teacher but he to distanced himself from the students and
          prepared defences and forces against them. Over the time the rift grew
          sharper and stronger until the second war of Terra broke out. When rebellions
          started in the city. Chaos erupted and at it's centre the magicians stood
          as people started question the power of magic. Magicans started to get
          targeted and killed during the rebellion and the time was finally ready
          as the undead forced of Vakan swept through the city like a plague. Liches
          and Death Knight controlled by Vakan defended the city and stroke the magicians
          foes one after another. However things did not go as Vakan predicted. The
          teachers watching the citizens of the city being butchered one after another
          tried to stop him. Only to be struck down themselves by the minions of
          Vakan as he stood by. "Those who stand against the progress of magic seek
          to destroy us. Even within our own midst we cannot trust those that once
          we thought as friends."</p>
        <p>It first started as a rebellion, Later it turned into a war as the leader
          Barristian sought to free the island from the Scandians. Now it had turned
          into genocide and Vakan marked as a massmurdered faced against two empires
          holding his ground fighting against the forces of men and women against
          his living dead. Three fourths of the cities population died that day and
          then eventually a visiting magicians from far away stepped up. Still young
          and somewhat older than Vakan he thought against him. Vakan struck down
          this aggorant wizard who he have never seen before. The person had ears
          and tanned skin. He had clothes of nobles and an air of authority to him.
          Unlike Vakan this person came from wealth and was the very thing that Vakan
          sought to destroy and at first he thought he would as he eventually got
          him hurt enough. "Die!" Vakan said casting his most powerful spell. A spell
          that could kill any man or woman and as the spell caster was struck by
          the spell the person revealed their true form. That of a golden greatwyrm.
          A creature that Vakan never thought existed before. Something he read at
          a young age only to be believed in the fairy tails of fiction. A dragon
          who just had their polymorphed form shattered, who now looked at him with
          pity. Not anger or hatred but with sadness in their eyes. "A frog inside
          the well knows nothing about the world and the strings of fate has brought
          me here to end your life. Althought your life will end it is not final
          as your story will continue. the dragons would release it's breath killing
          Vakan as his last day on Terra has come and with that all his control of
          the undead drops.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><strong>Aftermath</strong>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>It is ironic how the person fascinated about death now dead him self by
          the hubris of thinking he could learn everything there was to know. How
          he thought he could be the best of wizards and not face the death he controlled
          himself. Everybody dies and nothing lasts forever. Not even himself and
          as this thoughts whirled in his head, Vakan entered the afterlife and he
          expected to se a burning inferno of hell around him but instead he was
          greeted by a grey wasteland. A place that he have visited before as it's
          the place he claimed his powers from. The ethereal plane and as he looked
          down at his form he was a ghost and nothing more. A fraction of the power
          he once was now stood at the deaths door as he looks up to see the grim
          reaper in front of him. A being who knew and have read much about, a spectre
          that will send him onwards to his path into the afterlife. "So you have
          finally come my old friend. Will you now send me to hell for me to pay
          for my sins." He asks the creature mockingly and expectantly as it is something
          he imagined would happen when the war started years ago now. "No! You will
          not pass on. instead you will wander the empty void for all of eternity
          to pay for the souls you have forsaken. For those the souls you claimed
          and ended. You will not be given the mercy of death and instead will live
          for eternity and now the suffering of all you wish for. Cause, what you
          seek is not salvation, it is damnation and when you come to realise this
          and plead me to end your life, then know that I will not give it to you
          like I did this day. Your journey does not end here and enjoy your eternity."</p>
        <p>The reaper responds before it will leave Vakan. Confused and surprised
          it takes a good long time for the wizard to realise that he is left of
          the hook from his point of view. Vakan then for the first time in his life
          laughs. It is a cold long awkward laugh as he cheated death and is even
          blessed with endless time to study. It is a false laugh as it echoes into
          the void he is trapped as he laughs at the reaper for letting him go unpunished.
          It is false cause all the reasons he is laughing is null and void just
          like the place he finds himself inside.</p>
        <p>After his laughing fit is done, Vakan would start his long journey. A
          mere ghost do not hold much power as he wanders the ethereal plane. The
          wizard would fly around avoiding stronger spirits while claiming and saving
          energy. Lucky he considers himself to be, to know the nature of arcane
          as he gather it's energy slowly growing stronger. Lucky is he who knows
          the realm like the back of his hand and know what to do and what to avoid.
          Lucky is he, who have talked with the long dead that could tell him tails
          and give their knowledge onto of him. It's a long journey of years of gathering
          it's energy as he goes from ghost to spectre, From spectre to ghost and
          as his power grows he will become stronger still. During his absense the
          Barristan punk frees his now empire from the grasp of Scandia and forbids
          magic as Vakan in spectral form travels across the sea. He know the clothes
          and the skin tone of those from Addaria well. He will go to where his killer
          is and once like before. Like all those bullies that died by his hand and
          do the same to this being. He goes there and scower the desert to find
          a corpse to possess. To become a lich and most likely the most powerful
          lich the world has ever seen. A mummy lord and lich both in one as he goes
          to the tomb of a long dead king who once were a powerful spellcaster that
          Vakan knew about. As he possess the body and comes to life as undead he
          would not be alone as in the tomb the same greatwyrm that ended his life,
          stands there waiting for him.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><strong>A New Beginning</strong>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>-I see you have finally gained the powers to rise, Vakan." The golden
          great wyrm speaks out to the undead in front of him.</p>
        <p>-You! Why are you here! You ended my life and now you are here inside
          a tomb. Which still is unsealed and unbroken. How did you get inside here!?
          Are you here to end my life once more or are you here to simply mock me,
          dragon?"</p>
        <p>The great wyrm would give out a hearty chuckle. "Did I? Hmm! Perhaps that
          I did. However the fact you are alive is still a fact and no. I have not
          come to take your life." The dragon would respond.</p>
        <p>-Then why are you here?" The necromancer asks as Vakan would get out of
          the crypt and then hold the staff that was buried with the corps ready
          to defend himself.</p>
        <p>-I am here cause you are alive for a reason. Fate has deemed it so and
          you and I will no longer be of this world. We must go and leave this plane.
          We have many lives and worlds to save you and I. You also have a lot to
          learn about the worlds and the life you will live." The dragon responds.</p>
        <p>Vakan looks at him confused for a moment. "Worlds? What do you mean? Who
          are you!?" he asks the dragon.</p>
        <p>-I was once known as Fehrri Errhaborn Goldwing. I then became Addahria
          Addharan, first king and founder of Addahria. Now you can call Tye'Rhee.
          I have come on the behest of the raven queen, godess of fate and death
          and she might hate the undead but they are a small price for what must
          be saved." The golden greay wyrm says out loud to him.</p>
        <p>The fellow wizard takes a moment to let it all sink in before he would
          look up at him. "So there are other worlds?" Vakan asks hungry for knowledge
          as the dragon nods.</p>
        <p>-More worlds and timelines than one can percieve or experience and you
          will work for me from now on. I am a fate keeper and you my friend will
          be my hired hand." Tye'Rhee says as the dragon would come over and envelop
          the undead in it's wing as the two would take of to their next destination
          of Faerun.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><strong>The End -</strong>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The two would then arrive at Faehrun where they would go seperate ways
          for the time being. Vakan would head north to the kingdom of Netheril while
          Tye'Rhee flies east to the continent of Kara-Tur. One day the two would
          meet once more when it is time. In the meanwhile the two would gather power
          as Vakan would be there for the rise and fall of Netheril. Survive it all
          with the help of a certain sarrukh who teaches him the secrets of necromancy.
          In turn Vakan tells him of the many worlds and information Tye'Rhee told
          him to pass on. The sarrukh would then vanish as the two have traded. Vakan
          would then head into the sword coast and become a teacher at Candlekeep
          where he stays a teacher for a long long time. There he meets with Barthuc,
          Miriam and the many companions he would make as they then get involved
          in the crisis with Thay and the rising invasion of drow. All of the adventurers
          they would do and all the lives they would save was all true. Even Tye'Rhee
          was part of them as well. However there would be one thing that would break
          him and one thing he would never forgive his first and oldest friend for.</p>
        <p>As Barthuc and Miriam went to deal with the crisis in Eberron, Vakan stayed
          behind and once he got in contact he learned that his pupil were dead.
          Barthuc, Octavius, Alberich and Miriam. They first tried to plead with
          Tristan but he was with Verdh during all of this and had no power to help
          as he was invested in the war on a different front. Vakan then seeing her
          dead pupil knew what he had to do. Barthuc would not be happy with it but
          knew there was no other way stayed behind as the necromancer took his dead
          pupil away and performed a ritual he knew well as Miriam on that day would
          become a lich. Once the deed was gone Miriam reunited with her friends
          but just like Vakan she was different and knowing they would not be happy
          Vakan left. During the ritual he saw the reaper once more in front of him.
          As he found himself in the ethereal plane bringing Miriams soul back. This
          time it was was the reaper who would speak first. "So, old friend. We meet
          once more. How does it feel to live for eternity to be a husk of who you
          once were. To see your friends fall and die as you stay alive. How those
          you come in contact with, will not be there with you. You feel like you
          wanna cry but no cries will come. How their warmth will never reach your
          cold heart. How all their accomplishments comes to an end?" He asks as
          Vakan would see the images of his teachers dying so long ago. How the students
          learning necromancy at a young age then died by his undead. How Netheril
          rose as a paradise and ended in disaster. How the greedy arrogant necromancer
          of Thay fell who were no differnet from how he self were. How he killed
          his parents with his own hands for the pursuit of knowledge. How his now
          friends detested him as he have turned Miriam into what he self is and
          have become.</p>
        <p>-I hate it! I cannot feel but there are hatred in my bones and body. I
          wish I was dead and how she was alive. how they all were alive again. I
          never knew. How could I have?" Vakan says hating his own words that comes
          out of his mouth as they sound as emotionless and heartless as he once
          was even before he became a lich. Please bring her back as she was. Not
          as a lich but filled with life, hope and dreams, with love,warmth and happiness."

          the void.</p>
