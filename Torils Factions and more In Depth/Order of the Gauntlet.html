        <p>The order of the gauntlet is best described as a knightly brotherhood.
          They are sworn protector of the realm and is specilised in fighting against
          undeads and fiends. As part of joining the order you swore an oath much
          like a paladin would but do not have to be a paladin to become a member.
          The order accept all classes to join their fault but mostly consists of
          Paladins, Fighters and Clerics. Much like knights they patrol the sword
          coast and travels from place to place. They even at times have knigtly
          duels against each other in order to increase in rank or prove their worth
          and valor inside the order. Unlike a knightly faction they must not ride
          horses nor wear plate armours and is free to do as they please when they
          are free. When they are not free they are ordered by a superior much like
          inside an army of what to do next and where to go. At times of war and
          turmoil and conflict they are recruited by the lord's alliance or the king
          to help. During times of monarchy it is tradition for the leader of the
          faction to swar allegience to the crown as the guild works independantly
          from the lord's alliance and is known to have a ongoing rivalry with the
          comfy snobs as the members call them.</p>
