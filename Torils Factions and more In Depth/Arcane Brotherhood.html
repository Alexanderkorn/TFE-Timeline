        <p>The Arcane Brotherhood was first formed a long time ago as a vanguard
          for the Sword Coast and it's people against evil out there. It was a esteemed
          brotherhood of mages and witches of the arcane arts that protected the
          realms from dangers like dragons and fiends. However with the betrayal
          of Haddar turning on Mordenkainen and the eight the previous esteemed faction
          fell to corruption and was less focused on protecting the realm and more
          so of protecting the city of Luskan. The city of Luskan is governed by
          noble houses that are reffered to as ships and is metaphorical term for
          the trade empires that they run across the sword coast as they don't only
          act inside the city but also outside it's city wall. With the Fall of Tiamat
          the Brotherhood is being restructured and rebuilt to it's former glory
          under the watchful eye of the king and his loyal close friends.</p>
