        <p>The guild of Force Gray is a independant adventurer guild stationed in
          the city of Waterdeep. What sets it apart from the traditional guild is
          that they only allow spell casters to be able to join the guild with no
          exceptions. Graduates who wishes to adventure and dreams of things outside
          the schollar or serving the land often wishes to join this faction as it
          is highly sought after. At first the guild in it's younger days the guild
          only accepted spell casters of the arcane nature but in later days have
          accepted other classes like Druids and Clerics as well to join their ranks.
          In order to join you first have to undergo some tests to prove that you
          are an actuall spellcasting class of enough stature in order to be accepted
          as mearly having some spells from being a tiefling or having some items
          or being magic adept is not enough to get in.</p>
