        <p>About</p>
        <p>The Lords alliance is and was the goverment of the sword coast for the
          longest of times. It is a faction made and formed by various nobility in
          the Sword Coast that are spread through out the land. Once a year they
          have a meeting where they discuss current affairs and they always work
          in the betterment of the sword coast. Every decision they made is made
          through vote and has a democratic system in place so that no city or place
          will be favored over another. They are the founders of the Unified military
          of the sword coast and work together in times of war to fight foreign nations.
          In peace time they work as sponsors for adventuring parties that go and
          do quests for the various nobles when dangerous threats are around. For
          example a noble could come to the faction and tell them about a close by
          beholder taking his citizens. The faction then make a quests for it that
          then adventurers pickup and gets a reward from. The reward is either given
          by the nobility himself or the faction as payment for the service. The
          reason that the faction is willing to pay is because a danger to one part
          of the sword coast could later become a problem to the realm. However most
          nobility pay the reward themselves cause when you have gathering of nobilities
          in a faction who are all looking for self interest it becomes political
          game and every time there is a unified kingdom it rocks this boat.</p>
        <p>Many of the members inside the faction is against having a monarchy as
          it disrupts their trade and the faction.</p>
        <p> </p>
        <p>Contacts</p>
        <p>The Lords Alliance being both goverment and a guild when doing big operations
          such as war relies on their allies to make large moves and thus they have
          contacts with other goverments and guilds outside of The Sword Coast. Their
          closest allies are those fellow guilds who fight for good being The Harpers,
          Order of the Gauntlet and Emerald Conclave to name a few. They also have
          close ties to the city of Silverymoon and their Spellguard as well as connections
          with the neutral Almn to the south. Elturel is their closest military contact
          as in times of war has an alliance with eachother but the alliance between
          the elves of High Forest and the Lords Alliance their connections are tense.
          The other races that are friendly with them are the dwarves in the north.
          After all Mithral Hall and the dwarven queen is the dwarves direct contact
          with The Sword Coast.</p>
        <p> </p>
        <p>Operations</p>
        <p>When it comes to how the guild operates it is all dependant on scale for
          the guild. For example if there is a local threat around Triboar for example
          a guild member can grab a poster on their job board and carry out a mission
          like a normal adventurer in any guild. Somebody has issues with bandit
          and the mayor or lord has sent out a notice to have it fixed. However if
          it's a political matter the jobs are not posted and instead directly deliever
          to the people best suited for the task.</p>
        <p> </p>
        <p>For larger jobs such as taking out a speicific monster or getting a rare
          ingridient for a store it is a bit more complicated. Little is known about
          this but most adventurers in the sword coast is actually illegal as these
          missions required you to have a registered party with a guild that is associated
          with Force Grey, Lords Alliance, Order of the Gauntlet or any other guild
          in order to do the mission legaly.</p>
        <p>The reason for this like so many things are, is because of taxes ofc.
          Any mission or quest needs to be registered in a guild to be taxed and
          rewards are also taxed and regulated by the goverment of the Swordcoast.
          The best tax deals are made with the Lords Alliance since they are the
          actual goverment but they don't provide special skills or gear that other
          guilds do.</p>
        <p> </p>
        <p>Goals</p>
        <p>The Lords alliance is as much as a gorment of the sword coast as it is
          a guild as they hire adventurers from across Fahrun to protect the land
          against any and all kind of dangers. They often work with other guilds
          and helps turn the wheel with processing official business regarding trade
          to get things done. Because of them being the goverment they can provice
          special permissions to guilds and groups so that they can go to a place
          to kill a group of bandits that are harassing trade routes or go to a dragon
          lair and slay a dragon that is about to burn a city.</p>
        <p> </p>
        <p>Public Opinion</p>
        <p>The common folk revere the Lords Alliance like it's the only guild in
          the world as they are most well known and has the most iconic members as
          several nobles are part of the guild. Although none of the highmembers
          actually do any of the quests themselves, they are the poster childs and
          faces of the faction. You will see knights in shiny armour and fair ladies
          in fancy nobly clothes dressed as advneturers show casing the pristine
          and wonderous life of adventurers that can be had as a member. That is
          why adventurers are very well liked in cities and towns but it's also the
          very reason they are critiqued. Obviously it is all a farce and the grim
          reality of adventurers is overshadowed. None of those performerers are
          actual adventurers themselves and is just a PR stunt. Few of the actual
          leaders has any combat experience themselves and thus the guild is often
          made fun of by other adventurers belonging to other guilds.</p>
        <p> </p>
        <p>Leaders</p>
        <p> </p>
        <p>Laeral Silverhand, the Open Lord of Waterdeep</p>
        <p>Nobody knows what Leral Silverhand looks like in person as nobody has
          ever seen him/her. The identity of the ruler in Waterdeep afterall has
          always been a well kept secret as the waterdavian nobles that rule the
          city keeps all their identity secret and all wear masks. You never know
          if you speak with one of the nobles themselves or just a member of their
          court. This is no difference with Leral Silver hand and regarding his displeasure
          against having a king has ever been made clear.</p>
        <p>Dagult Neverember, Lord Protector of Neverwinter</p>
        <p>Since Dagult Neverember was deposed as the Open Lord of Waterdeep, he
          has thrown his full attention and effort into the rebuilding of the city
          from which he claims descent.</p>
        <p>Whatever people’s opinions are of his claim to Neverwinter’s throne, he
          has proven a capable, inspiring leader over these last few years, and the
          population has embraced him as Lord Protector.He engineered the sealing
          of the Chasm and the restoration of the High Road, and is seeking other
          ways to repair and improve the city. Even if he can never prove his descent
          from Lord Nasher Alagondar, the people of Neverwinter have accepted his
          leadership.</p>
        <p>Dagult is a proud supporter of the current king of the Sword Coast despite
          his somewhat mixed noble court over the matter. The one noble that have
          spoken most ill of the king is a woman named by Eliza Amitel. She and some
          of her followed consider a king to be not necessary and to be a mere distraction.
          After all the sword coast have not had a king for hundreds of year and
          been just fine without it. However a minority they and not a democracy
          she has little to no power to make an actual attempt. However things might
          change with the rebellion around the corner.</p>
        <p>Taern Hornblade, High Mage of Silverymoon</p>
        <p>Unlike his father Thorn Hornblade Taern practiced the arcane as a wizard
          and gained famed and renown the arcanists and spell casters. Unexperienced
          in politics yet gifted, he is highly regarded among the lords alliance
          and is a voice of reasons in a chorus of strong opinions. He does not hold
          high regards to the king but no ill intentions either, staying neutral
          in the debate. In his opinion strength in combat alone is not what makes
          a great leader if one is even needed.</p>
        <p>Ulder Ravengard, Grand Duke of Baldur’s Gate and Marshal of the Flaming
          Fist</p>
        <p>As a military leader and protector of the realm, Uldear is a big fan over
          the new king and during their meetings they have found themselves, friends.
          They have very simillar opinion and reactions to the dangers of the sword
          coast and also have similar distaste for more diplomatic meassures.</p>
        <p>Morwen Daggerford, Duchess of Daggerford</p>
        <p>Unlike the waterdeep nobles, Morwen does not dirrectly oppose the king
          and is choosing a more cold hearted, "neutral" approach to the matter as
          she uses finesse and diplmacy to get avoid questions. A minor faction of
          the sword coast but important one. Morwen controls a lot of trade along
          the river out into the ocean and is a major stop on the road between Baldurs
          Gate and Waterdeep. Given her situation she remains in the backseat of
          politics not as a mayor player but a great asset for Waterdeep.</p>
        <p>Selin Ramur, Marchion of Mirabar</p>
        <p>In the heart of the city that stands as a capital to the sword coast,
          Selin Ramur is against the king but not in a good position to state her
          opinion. Selin is a queiet shy elderly women. She still have an aura of
          beaty but she has never held any true power. Her streangth laid in information
          and conspiracy as she somehow managed to be an idol of fashion and beaty
          by her younger peers. Her choise of clothes often comes to be the latest
          trend despite her intention of it or not. She often attends galas and events
          in any major city and travels alot which might be why she has no foothold
          in Mirabar. The term "Silence is golden" is one that was named after her
          as she could attend a week long event but not utter a single word. Rumors
          has even spread that she is mute. Selin however amongst her allies are
          known as the maiden of whispers as she probably have dirt on every noble
          in Faehrun.</p>
        <p>Dowell Harpell of Longsaddle</p>
        <p>A simple ship builder and currently transport leader has found him self
          to be in a position of powers he never sought as Harpell started his business
          making carts. A simple trade that he then expanded on as he started to
          make investments in different companies and all of sudden finding him self
          to be one of the richest men in the sword coast.</p>
        <p>Dagnabbet Waybeard, Queen of Mithral Hall</p>
        <p>The queen of Mithral Hall has only thanks and appreciations for the king
          as the kingdom have helped her people more than once on occations and her
          family has always have held the realm and it's people in high regards.
          She is well versed with adventurers and their kin and has no issues with
          one becomming a ruler.</p>
        <p>Lord Dauner Ilzimmer of Amphail</p>
        <p>Located north of Waterdeep Amphail has some serious pressure on his shoulders
          as the simple plump lord Dauner is not that comfortable being pressured
          by the waterdavian nobles and his court that wants him to side against
          the king and the important role he has trading with Triboar where his good
          friend is located. Dauner does indulge much in politics and just wants
          to live a comfortable life trading as he is currently regretting his position
          of Lord at the moment.</p>
        <p>Nestra Ruthiol, Waterbaron of Yartar</p>
        <p> </p>
        <p>Located in the easter part of Sword Coast, Nestra is holding a netral
          side of the dispute about the king as he is playing both sides. Living
          close to resourses of all kinds and then selling them east and all dirrections
          via Triboar trail the Waterbaron is one of the wealthiest men in Sword
          Coast. He has greate influence as he is playing all cards in his hands
          making deals with pretty much everybody he is able to while being at the
          centre protected from all sides.</p>
        <p>Personality wise he is as slimy as you imagine willing to trade his own
          family for a fortune if he can get away with it.</p>
