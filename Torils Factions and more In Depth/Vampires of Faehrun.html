        <p>It is uncertain how old the lady is as she is currently one of the oldest
          vampires still in Faehrun and one of the most powerful night walkers out
          there. The one clue a person could get from how timeless she is, hail from
          the fact that she grew up during the rise of Cormy more than 3'000 years
          ago. Still not as old as dragons but impressive none-the less. Her age
          though is not what makes her one of the stronger vampires out there as
          that is due to her keen mind and blood line. Her blood line is one of the
          purest and thus her only vampire weakness is the sun it self and her vampire
          abilities are that of Tier 5 which is the strongest a vampire can get.</p>
        <p>Lady Ayalin might be a mythical being of ancient times and one of the
          strongest vampires in existence but streangth comes in many shapes. She
          is not a fighter and she hate violance. If a fight is forced on her she
          will do so but it's not an outcome she would prefer. Her streangth comes
          due to her intelligence as she uses sweet words for diplomacy and history
          to her benefit. She makes deals with those she can trust and make offerings
          where she deems it necessary to do so. For example if a group of adventurers
          would threaten her life, she would instead rather to help the adventurers
          and be their allies. If that does not work she will offer them something
          she could part with for her life as she wants anything else but a fight.</p>
        <p> </p>
        <p>Ever since she grew up in Cormyr she has always been a pacifist, choosing
          a path of diplomacy over violance and she studied history, art, litterature,
          music and much more as much she could find and learn. She loves romance
          novels and poetry and it's through her studies that she found her husband.
          A doctor by the name of Davian Croft. Like she he had a thirst of knowledge
          and studied all he could, the difference is that he also studied the arcane.
          Something she always admired and fantasised about but it was a gift she
          never could master. They studied together, drank fine wines due to his
          increasing popularity and knowledge of medicine and eventually the two
          would fall in love. Something that would end before it would last for the
          rest of their lives as Davian was a noble in Cormy he falling in love with
          Ayalin who to his families eye was a mere servant their relationship was
          frowned upon. Davian though did not care and wanted to visit the Sword
          Coast and go travel asked Ayalin of she wanted to run away with her. Ayalin
          agreeded and with none of them being that good fighters the ambush set
          up by the Croft family ended their lives then and there. Luckily for the
          two of them a friend of Davian was nere. He gave them the crimson gift
          and with the two of them dead they ventured west towards a new land where
          they could live happily ever after.</p>
        <p> </p>
        <p>After the betrayal Croft started to learn how to fight and Ayalin used
          her contacts and political skill to garner a safe haven in the far north
          in a forest. Together the two moved into the Cold Wood into a small village.
          The years passed by and once Croft was ready he left Ayalin in charge of
          things at home while he went to Cormy to avange their deaths. Ayalin agreed
          and one night a woman holding a young elven boy arrived at her footsteps.
          Both were dying and Ayalin knowing nothing about medicine decided to give
          them some of her blood as the two gained the crimson gift. This is how
          the croft family gre w into two more. Davian was surprised but not opposed
          to the idea of expanding their family as afterall. He have gained a wife
          and now a lover which Ayalin was fine with. Afterall a doctor gains a lot
          of stress and two women is better at relieving him of it than just one
          who recently have gotten a noble title in Neverwinter and now often busy
          with the political game. Davian took care of things in Cormyr and Thalia
          who became Davians pupil was left in charge of the castle they had built
          in order to house the growing family.</p>
        <p> </p>
        <p>Now days Ayalin is trying to gain favour with a war lord by the name of
          Drazzor and at the same time trying to stay on the new queens good grace
          as she sees the queen as one of her closest friends but Queen Esseren can
          not give her what she wants and that is a home in Neverwinter due to her
          condition. They are friends and thus the secret is known to the queen which
          puts her in a difficuily spot. If Drazzor would become king than she and
          her husband was promised a place at the castle for their help in favouring
          other nobles to his cause. Something Ayalin hopes to accomplish as she
          knows quite well how discrimination and hate can feel and she like Drazzor
          hopes everybody could live happily together no matter what they look like.</p>
