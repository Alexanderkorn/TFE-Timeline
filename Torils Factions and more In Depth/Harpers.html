        <p>About</p>
        <p>The USA has the CIA, Russia has the KGB and Sweden has their Special Defence
          Unit.</p>
        <p>Any great nation requires it's own specialy trained agents who are willing
          to defend their world against foreign and internal threats and thus the
          harpers were created. Just like the previous mentioned it is a well known
          faction across the sword coast and to treat the harpers as mere spies is
          an understatement. Unlike the previously mentioned the harpers does not
          work according to poitic and does not have an allegience to any nation.
          They work as spies, soldiers and adventurers to defeat evil wherever it
          works and is the more traditional adventurers group in that they accept
          any and all classes no matter what your past may have been as long you
          are working for the greater good. Because of this though and the fact that
          members are treated as spies the general fold in Faehrun do not trust the
          harpers and is seldom inclined to shair their information with members.
          A harper never needs to tell anybody that they are a member to get what
          they need is a common phrace inside of the faction.</p>
        <p> </p>
        <p>Contacts</p>
        <p>The Harpers is a spy agency and thus they don't tend to reach out to other
          guilds and factions if it can be helped. However as they do work for the
          goverment as their biggest client they do have connections naturally with
          the current kingdom and the Lord's Alliance as they are needed to work
          together to some extent. However all of this is ofcourse done in secrecy
          as the guild has a covert classification over it. Considering the elements
          of their jobs it is also naturaly to say that they have some ties with
          the Zentharim as their other main contact as it's part of their job to
          spy which leads them into criminal contacts. Other than that they do have
          a small military detail to them which puts them into contacts with some
          order of knigts and with the Order of the Gauntlet to an amount. More so
          during war times.</p>
        <p> </p>
        <p>Operations</p>
        <p>Harpers are most and foremost spies for the Lord's Alliance but they are
          a still a guild and takes on missions just like any other guilds that operates
          in Faehrun. Although they don't mainly focus on killing monsters it is
          part of their job descriptions. The difference between the harpers and
          other guilds as that each member often operates alone or in groups no larger
          than 3 or 4 people. So the jobs they take on is rarely large monsters but
          small missions where some covert skills might be needed.</p>
        <p>Just like a certain Jedi Order, Harpers work with many, many members and
          with an amount of high harpers as superiors. Some of these members have
          aprentices which makes rank and details a mess. The leader of the harpers
          nobody know and is on purpose kept that way as everything within the guild
          is often a need to know basis. Nobody knows because nobody needs to know
          and as long one get paid it's not important. The harpers work for the good
          of all and that is evident in the work they do so most people don't question
          the secrecy and all the members think is that one of the high harpers must
          be their secret nr 1 leader.</p>
