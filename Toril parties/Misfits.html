        <p>Rimi grew up in the Border Forest as an orphan together with her best
          friends Ihra, Ayda and Tom who all stuck around and often got into trouble.
          Each of them had seperated druidic abilities as Rimi is a druid of the
          Shephard, Ihra is a moon druid, Ayda is a druid of the stars and Tom is
          a spore druid. They trained under their elder Lahrra who is a high elf
          that everybody calls Gran Gran despite her young looks. Easch of them had
          responsibilites as Ayda studied nature and history and was one day to be
          the next elder of the circle. Tom studied agrculture and food production
          and how to tend to crops while Ihra helped around with about everything.
          Rimi was in charge of taking care of all their animals and was their acolyte
          of the Wild Mother, Mellora.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>When growing up Rimi had a pleasant upbringing and despite the many misschief
          often came up by Tom she did not pay to attention to their teachings and
          rather fooled around. She always wondered about her parents though and
          thought to herself that maybe the reason they left her there was because
          they did not love her. That's maybe why the abandoned her to the druid,
          something she never told anybody, not even to her closest friends. What
          she did tell them though is that she had a crush on Ihra as girls growing
          up often do. The problem was that her absoulute BFF also had a crush on
          him and the two had a big fight one day as Ihra choice Ayda over her. However
          as times passed on their young fling did not last as they then became friends
          once more.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>One day people were panicking and there was a new smell in the grove as
          Rimi smelled fire. She tried to find her friends but instead found Gran
          Gran who told her that they already ran and she needs to flee as well.
          Rimi never having left the grove did as she was told and ran and ran and
          ran for a long time until she could run no more. Afterwards she got lost
          in a large strange world until one day she returned to see the grove gone.
          She went to Whitehorn disheartened hoping that some of her folk might be
          there. Instead she found herself a traveling party. As she went on an epic
          journey, fighting aberrations, vampires an annoying purple guy. She found
          her grove but also herself as the naïve, innocent bunny girl quickly started
          to grow up learning the world and eventually becoming the leader of her
          own grove as the Matreon of the forest and finding herself some love in
          her future wife Akhaly as they both gained their last name of Wildclaw</p>
