        <p>Astaroth is a old gnome who is 362 years old. He was born in the year
          1144 DR and was but a child back then. He grew up dreaming of being a member
          among the eigth learning about all their adventures. Once he got a lecture
          from Mordenkainend during his time at Candlekeep and it's a day he will
          never forget. However as he grew older he quickly learned the dangers of
          adventures and grew out of his child hood dreams. For the longest time
          he owned a small magic store. It became more of a part time job while he
          started studying alchemy and politics. As Astraroth become more involved
          in the politics of the sword coast eventually ended up being the kings
          advisor.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The Sword Coast have often from being a monarch to independant city states
          many times which facinated Astaroth and when he got the chance of being
          invited to join as an advisor for the new king he basically jumped at the
          oppurtunity. Dealing with Baldritch though he slightly regrets his decision.</p>
