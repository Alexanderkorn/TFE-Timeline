        <p>Vellaia is an interesting woman. She is curios on how everything works
          but also cares a lot about others. At a young age she got sent into the
          wild to take care of her own and make a name of herself.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>In her travels she learned a lot. Thinks like don’t trust everyone and
          watch your back. Even though that she loves to meet people and especially
          people with a lot of knowledge. In her endeavors she ended up losing one
          eye and got a hand full of scars on her back. This didn’t stop her from
          doing what she loved, traveling. With or without companions she didn’t
          mind either.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>While traveling Vallaia started working for a bandit and mercenary group.
          Things went well until they thought she was stealing gold. That was not
          the case. She was helping a local church of the nature God to help build
          a house for the pour. Boris the leader of the mercenary's and bandits didn't
          like it and ordered Vallaia to stop. She didn't listen. Boris asked it
          only once after hearing she didn't stop he ordered his man to kill her.
          With help of her ally inside the mercenary's James. She managed to escape
          but lost her eye in an sword fight with one of the bandits. Once she was
          out she knew she had to run. She asked if James would join her bet he refused.
          He promised her he would continue to build the house for the nature God
          in her honer and kissed her. He pushed her away and went back to the camp
          trying to not get her caught or himself.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Vallaia still thinks back about those days. The things she has done and
          wished she hadn't done.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>She ended up traveling with a party in the feywilde and meeting <a href="onenote:#Kai%20Spellbound%20Mastermind%20and%20Master%20of%20Espionage%20for%20the%20&amp;section-id=%7B08640dc0-c503-4f40-92a5-67e62cad949a%7D&amp;page-id=%7Be4973c6b-b684-4a80-8848-bd360400ad9c%7D&amp;end">Kai</a> there.
          A thiefling she fell in love with and stayed with. While in the feywilde,
          the party prevented a demon invasion and was transported back to the material
          plane. Some stayed behind and some went with Vellaia and <a href="onenote:#Kai%20Spellbound%20Mastermind%20and%20Master%20of%20Espionage%20for%20the%20&amp;section-id=%7B08640dc0-c503-4f40-92a5-67e62cad949a%7D&amp;page-id=%7Be4973c6b-b684-4a80-8848-bd360400ad9c%7D&amp;end">Kai</a>.
          Vellaia went to the Harpers and worked with them before getting rapidly
          promoted thru the ranks. In 1506 DR she is the leader of the Harpers.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>While working she found out that James her old flame was killed by the
          bandits. She payed him her respect and closed that chapter of her life.
          Sometimes her past haunts her but she gets help from <a href="onenote:#Kai%20Spellbound%20Mastermind%20and%20Master%20of%20Espionage%20for%20the%20&amp;section-id=%7B08640dc0-c503-4f40-92a5-67e62cad949a%7D&amp;page-id=%7Be4973c6b-b684-4a80-8848-bd360400ad9c%7D&amp;end">Kai</a> and
          vice versa.</p>
