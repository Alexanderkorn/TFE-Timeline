        <p>Brigadier Jackson Cole is at the age of 47 and was born the year 1459
          DR. The Cole family did not start as a noble house but later on became
          one through the great deeds they have made since their instatement into
          the military. This started with Jackson's father being enlisted by Garedd
          of House Esseren in Mirabar as a personal body guard and protector of the
          city. Jackson's father Mathias Cole have taken down bandits, an invading
          hobgobiln army orchestrated from Phandelver by the late now dead hobgoblin
          king. Due to the familys fame even though they were recruited from a poor
          none noble familiy when Jackson was young, his dad Mathias got promoted
          to Brigadier in the military of the Sword Coast. Now days Mathias is retired
          and his promising son Jackson is in charge.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Jackson during his upbringing is his fathers son. He always admired his
          father and always tried to live up to his fathers standards and unlike
          the troupe Mathias have supported him through his life. Due to this though
          his mother was left behind and with her husband always busy with work and
          her son chasing in his foot step. She and Mathias seperated. She now lives
          a comfortable life as a court woman by the name of Elizabeth in Mirabar.</p>
