        <p>Ehrahni is one of the seven ward from the feywild and one amongst seven
          sisters.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>At a young age she quckly became the leader of her siblings and took on
          a somewhat parenting role for her other sisters. As the more responsible
          one she often made sure the other behavend and did as the king tree has
          taught them. She often was the voice of advise if anybody of them were
          in trouble or had concerns. However as a leader with no parents this was
          a double edged sword.</p>
        <p>While her sisters could rely on her she herself had nobody for her self
          to rely on and took on the burden from her family alone. A burden she carries
          on her shoulds till this day and as they met the different fey courts she
          at times made deals on her sisters behalf and had to do something she is
          not proud of her in her adult life. When the split happened she chose the
          world of Toril and secluded and seperate she is in Toril still and do not
          plan on seeing her kin maybe never.</p>
