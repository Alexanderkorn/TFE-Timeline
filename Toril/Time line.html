          causing calamity and is believed be the source of all of wild magic. Which
          Ezekel calls BS on.</p>
        <p>-12'000 DR The First Flowering and all the Sword Coast is basically conqured
          by elves at this poiint but nothing last forever as civil war stars and
          the first crown war starts between two of their cities. Aryvandaar that
          was ruled by Sun Elves (Gold Elves) against Miyeritar that was governed

          year hold to rebuild and get back the forest and nature. At the second
          crown war and during the piece treaty a lot of elves breks off not wanting
          any part of the war and this is where Sea Elves starts becomming a thing
          in the sea and it's also during this time that Mindflayer and many otherworly

          know who or why they casted it as one culprit is the sun elves and the
          other is the dark elves and the third is resistance forces within the city
          of the moon elves in the occupied city. This is still debated to this day.

          to their pantheons and Corellon answered by cursing all elves with sensitivity
          to the sun forcing them to flee into the underdark. However it was not
          over yet as the last actual fifth crown war was decreed by the elven pantheons
          themself against the very elves that started all of this. The sun elves
          was now facing against all the remaining elves fighting against them with
          the elven pantheons backing them.</p>
