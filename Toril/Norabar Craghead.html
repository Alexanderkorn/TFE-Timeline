        <p>Norabar is a dwarf born in the year of 1304 in the city of Mithral Hall.
          At the age of only 50 Norabar decides to leave his dwarven home to adventure
          The Sword Coast in order to learn about the various cultures. He would
          eventually find him self traveling further all the way to Calimport where
          he would stay and studies. During his pilgrimage as he calls it he discovered
          many things and one of those things were the arcane that he took to practice
          as soon he learned to read. He was not particullary good nor bad at it
          but had a insight in the destruction of evocation and thus decided to become
          a master at it. Especially when it came for fire magic. He became so good
          at in fact that when he tried to leave his master tried to force him to
          stay and a battle in the city would occur. His master was kind enough to
          teach him magic but the evild red dragon that taught him the magic had
          other plans for the dwarf. It tried to force and enslave his pupils in
          order to control them and then later take over the city. The dwarf thought
          back the dragon and outnumbered and outmatched he was about to loose. However
          he would not find himself fighting the dragon alone after the hundreds
          of year he spent studying. Another wizard followed by some friends. Most
          who were spell casters themselves. Eventually they finished of the enslaved
          wizards and the ancient red dragon as Norabar would join the Pentharam
          as one of it's members as thanks for their aid. In turn they took him on
          more adventurers as they traveled all over Faehrun and later on even other
          worlds.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>At the end of their adventurer the drama started to occur. He and his
          best friend who he loved and hated by the name of Balasar accompinied him
          back to Mithral Hall as the dwarf took a long moment saying farewell to
          his two most beloved friends by the name of Octavius and Alberich. Since
          then Balsara and Norabar has been a duo doing some adventurers themselves
          before arriving at their home.</p>
