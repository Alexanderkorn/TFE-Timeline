        <p>Backstory: From a young age Baldrich was teached to listen to authority.
          His parents were simple people. They worked the land and traded. Baldrich
          rarely got in trouble but when it happened it was big. There was not much
          in the village of Longsaddle. Baldrich is a only child. With this came
          that he became very independent and knew how to get the people around him
          to follow him and use their strengths. With this it came quite clear that
          he needed to teched to be very strict. His mother Anna was the caring one
          while his dad Fumar trained him to hit back and not get beaten down. When
          the army came looking for volunteers, he was the first in his village to
          step forward and fight for the kingdom. While training he showed dedication
          and persistence. He made quick friends with people that were outcasts and
          higher ups. Following orders, he looked up at the paladins that lead them
          in battle. With his half orc Barry next to him. He went into many battles
          slowly losing people around him but never people in his group. Other soldiers
          looked at Baldrich in time of need as he managed to lead them to safety.
          Soon after he entered his mother got sick and died of the disease. His
          father is still alive and healthy. Baldrich hasn’t dared to visit his dad
          after he died in the firth battalion. He is afraid of scaring his dad to
          death. Baldrich is no stranger to death. Considering he died in a war and
          got resurrected.</p>

          against it to work for a better world. Under the common folk he's beloved
          and praised. His down to earth nature makes him a pleasant person to be
          around. Baldrich on his own is not the strongest. His powers are the unification
