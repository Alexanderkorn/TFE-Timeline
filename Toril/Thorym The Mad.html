        </p>
        <p>Thorym was born the year 1123 and is one of four brothers. Orryn the Chaos
          is the most known amongst his family Thorym went a different dirrection.
          Gifted in the arcane both went to Candlekeep and both excelled in their
          studies but one thing that seperated them, even from a young age is that
          Thorym was born with a defect. He was born mad and showed erratic behaviours
          seeing things that was not there and talking to creatures nobody else could
          see or hear.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Some people who are interwoven in the weave becomes sorcerers and those
          who are entangled in it becomes wild mages. Thorym was a different case
          entirely and during his time in Candlekeep he was the case study for many
          spell casters. Sick and mad but gifted in seeing the past, present, future
          and mind trapped in the ethereal. The studies showed that it was not like
          he could see the future but experiences it in first person. Like he was
          there during the terrible times but also the magnificant times of wonders.</p>
        <p>He has a translocated mind so it was not that he is mad per say but when
          you are born questioning everything you see and not even sure when or where
          you are then it sure can drive you mad.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Despite his flaw Thorym excelled in his studies at Candlekeep and while
          communication was hard there was ways and time you could communicate. It
          was not the school that reached out to him but he himself studying using
          the resources around him as the school did nothing to teach him magic and
          only allowed the gnome to teach him self the magic needed to craft spells
          and to make an enchanted book that allowed two people to write to eachother
          across planes and regardless of distance. Thoryms Book of Communication.
          For the first time in his life Thorym could communicate with other through
          text regardless of where he found his mind to be.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>During his childhood not much was understood about the child and the young
          Thorym was just acting mad. After showing his skill in magic he was sent
          to Candlekeep as he was studied. There he learned magic and make magic
          items but on the side Thorym was also given the assets needed to record
          and to study the magnificant creatures he took interest in. Giants! Since
          the chaos war to the dragon giant war and the giant civil war they have
          all been a big and important part in the history of Toril. Thorym learned
          this quite quickly living through the future and past and took it upon
          himself to study the creatures and their history in detail. Not many people
          know this as it's kept secret but the runic magic that exist is because
          it's magic that Thorym documented from the giants and shared with friends
          and fellow spellcasters cause as his condition was so rare and so unique
          many famous wizards and arcanists took interest in the gnome.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Born during the adventorous time of the 9 he was later visited by Mordenkainen
          himself once and several other spell casters that took interest in him.
          Another was named Barthuc Barletho who took an interest in the gnome. The
          two of them came to know each other quite well during this time and Thorym
          became an unofficial member of the Pentharam but Barthuc always kepts Thorym
          at an arms lenght as did the gnome towards him as the two never came to
          trust eachother fully. Little did Barthuc know that a certain Ezekel became
          closer with the gnome and instead of keeping a distance took a keen liking
          to Thorym and later on even got the gnomes help to make a lesser copy of
          himself that could stay around while Ezekel was elsewhere. The two worked
          together in secret for the longest time and eventually when the time was
          ready Ezekel copy left to form a mage guild in Baldurs Gate while Thorym
          after long ago leaving Candlekeep made his own business in Waterdeep as
          an expert on Giants for researchers and to this very day continues to record
          and study history where he sees it with his mind.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Much to many's demise the gnome has never recorded the future despite
          able to see it, stating that no good will ever come from knowing ones future.
          Knowing to much about history, Waterdeep considers Thorym a security risk
          and pays him well and in turn keeps his location city which Thorym partially
          agrees to as according to the gnome, only those smart enough and clever
          enough should be given the information he has as only those would be willing
          to use his knowledge for sensible things.</p>
