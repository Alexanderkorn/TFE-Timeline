        <p>Kai which translates to Ash in infernal was born in the sixth layerer
          of the hells in the realm of Melbolge. A nasty place with slaves working
          to cut the black Stygian rock under the cruel rule of Glasya. It's the
          home of the succubus and Incubus and while the fiends enjoy their depravity
          the rest is forced into labour. Between the massiv black blocks of rock
          a sea of green poisonous gas flows like rivers between the mass of lands.
          That is the poison you can see. However even the air is hard to breath
          in and the whips from the barbed devils at ones back does not help. This
          is the world that Kai was brought into.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The gracing benefit is that you are not forced to work as a tiefling her
          the second you are born but you are often seperated from your birth paretns
          and even if you are not the birthing is rarely consentual fro, the mother.
          Kai did have a surogate mother though who cared for him and stood up to
          him when he was young. However it was not easy especially since Kai always
          been a shy quiet kid and later on adult as well.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>This was a blessing in disguise though as he rarely got into trouble and
          often was ignored while the other tieflings native to the plane and other
          humanoids who had their souls taken got punished.</p>
        <p>Once Kai was at the wrong place at the wrong time he still got punished
          and often more severely than the others. Less punishment usually means
          it's more severe when you do get it in Melbolge.</p>
        <p>Unlike Kai his mother Kahrri was quite the opposite. She often stood up
          for people and took on others punishments. She was rebelious tiefling with
          a hot tempre and got often into trouble. A few times Kai tried to stop
          her rebelious attitude but it would only make things worse.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The two were not close but they were still family. During the day of working
          they were seperate and distant from eachother for the most part and during
          the time they rested they often found eachother and snuggled to help eachother
          sleep. They rarely talked as his mother knew that he was more of the quiet
          type and usually allowed to Kai speak if he wished to. This is one of the
          reasons Kai never found out her plan of escape.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Kai knew something was up though but he was not sure what. He had seen
          Kharri talk with many of the other captives over the course of days that
          was before. Something that was very unusuaul for people as if they would
          get caught talking they would be whipped. Kai expected her to talk to him
          since from his point of view they were really close. However she never
          did and one day all of sudden it happened. The captives all banded together
          as they outnumbered the fiends who had them captured. They managed to kill
          one but what they were not aware of is that the security was higher that
          day.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The leader of the Melbolge Glasya at that time had invited Lady Fierna
          and Arch Duke Belial from the fourth layer of hell Phlegethos to visit
          her. Glasya a succubus and Fierna also a succubus while Belial an incubus
          all were quite close. Glasya was used to lend them slaves for torture in
          the jade palace and it was one of the worst fate only the most disobdient
          prisoners got.. With the heightened security around the three rulers of
          the hells who even heard the comotion came over to see the rebelion. Seeing
          this Kharri would block their path to try and make sure the rest would
          escape while Kai tried to pull her away from the incoming forces and pit
          fiends. He then frose in fear as Glasya her self came over with her friends.
          Everybody involved got captured. Kharri the leader was sentenced to obliteration
          which means that she would be killed that in turn would destroy her souls
          and cease to exit. The directly involved would be sent to Phlegethos for
          extreme torture. Glasya who have seen her with Kai knew he was like a son
          to her would Kai the most severe punishment of a whole years of torture.
          Getting such a severe punishment Kai sees Glasya is about to strike and
          for the first times in his life shouts at Glasya to stop and gets in her
          way.</p>
        <p>Shocked Glasya stays her blade for a moment before rage takes her over.
          "How dar you speak back to me" Glasya shout back at him and then comes
          with a fiting punishment for him. She takes her blade and cuts his throat
          and uses her powers to stop the bleeding. Kai at the age of 14 at this
          point would get 2 years of special torture from Fierna and Belial themselves
          for this insolense. Kai then sees Glasya ends his mothers existence before
          he is taken away to a fate worse than the one he endured so far.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>A taboo in the hells is to say that things could not get worse becasuse
          it always can and Kai experienced this first hand as Fierna and Belial
          took him to their jade palace in the fourth layer of hell and would experiemnt
          and torture him from he woke up till he passed out. At all time screaming
          in pain and agony without a sound coming from him and hurting his throat
          when he did. For three years he endured this and once they were done he
          was not much but a ghost tossed a side. A misstake by Fierna and Belial
          who left him alone in their palace to wander around not thinking much of
          him as they had grown bored of their toy and wanting a new victim.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Kai would for a month not move not needing water or food but still starving
          and dying thirst unable to pass on would suffer a bit more till he got
          his strenght to walk. He wandered the palace quiet like he has always been
          until he found a gate and not thinking much of it curiously stepped through
          as he ended up on the streets of Waterdeep.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>As he arrived at Waterdeep it was better but as a tiefling with gray skin
          and with superstition of being part fiends people he met was rarely nice
          to him. At least it was better from what he had been trhough before. For
          a time Kai lived on as an urchin stealing if he could but otherwise eating
          what he could find from the trash. It would not always bee this way though
          as one day Kai found somebody in need. He heard a comotion from an alley
          nearby and decided to check it out as he saw a group of teenage thugs kick
          something on the ground laughing. As he wondered what they were doing he
          saw a bit of orange fur as what they were kicking was a orange taby. Seeing
          them kick the stray cat Kai did not think and and acted as if they would
          go on further the cat would surely die. He jumped and shielded the cat
          in his arms with all of his might as the teenagers were confused at first
          but then pummeled Kai who took the beating instead of the cat just like
          how his mother have done it for Kai when he was younger.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>What Kai was not aware of, is that he was not alone in the alley that
          day. On the rooftop looking down above a high harper was looking down at
          the whole incident and before he was going to intervene Kai instead did.
          Kai who he had not seen or heard despite being a high harper did not see
          or notice the tiefling who were hiding and looking at this. As the boys
          left tired and bored, the hooded man watched them putting their faces to
          mind for later in case he would tach them a lesson before looking back
          at the tiefling and the orange cat as Kai took care of it and naming it
          Cerias.</p>
        <p>Kai=Ash iin infernal</p>
        <p>Cerias=Cinder in infernal</p>
        <p>The hooded man hesitated hearing that and simply observed the two for
          a time before he would then come up to Kai and introduce him as Gahle and
          wanted to hire him as an aprentice. This is how Kai eventually became a
          trained spy for Gahle never learning who he worked for but did what was
          asked of him. Kai also trained Cerias and took care of him as the three
          grew closer so did Kai grow stronger.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>After that Kai gets his first mission that would lead him on a path of
          magic and wonder inside the adventures of the feywild where he forms a
          new party and finds love. He meets friends and together they free the feywild
          against the tyranny of one of Glasyas generals. Kai eventually retire together
          with his new love as they get married in the feywild before leaving as
          a couple back to the material plane. Vellaia and Kai becomes proper citizens
          and forms a family that they will start together.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>In the past 10 years Kai has been the hidden leader of the harpers and
          will soon retire after the war as Vellaia wants his kid for their father
          to be arounds which the harpers normally do not allow from their hidden
          leader-</p>
