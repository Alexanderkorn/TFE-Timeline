        <p>Helio Balthar is a Abjuration Wizard who graduated from Candle Keep quite
          a while ago. He was born 1454 DR and is currently working as the head advisor
          for the king and was for a brief moment a member of the arcane brother
          hood but only after a few years of servie he left and later got into the
          position he is in right now. He had the name of Helio the Purple. Not much
          is known about him and he was more of a loner during his class years as
          he likes to keep to himself and his studies when he is not working.</p>
