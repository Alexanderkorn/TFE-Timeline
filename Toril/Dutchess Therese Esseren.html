        <p>Therese Esseren is often confused as the princess and daughter of Queen
          Esseren. She is however a niece of the last heir of Esseren. However she
          would not become queen as one of her old ancestors instead took the throne
          in her stead leaving her as a Dutchess.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Dutchess Therese Esseren was born the year 1476 DR in the city of Mirabar
          under house Esseren. The house is not that big as it once used to be and
          unlike the days of old when the house used to rule the city it have shrunk
          down only to small family. There was Mathias Esseren who was her father.
          Treshie Esseren her mother who died during childbirth. Mathias was brother
          to Mathias Esseren who had no family of his own.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Mathias during the time of the second sundering managed to become quite
          high in power as he was dreaming of a united Sword Coast. He together with
          a good friend Bruenor Battlehammer had connection throughout the kingdom
          but unlike his goodfriend, Gerrad dove quite deep into the politics. During
          a time of krisis he used it as a crowdfunder as he was eventually liked
          by all nobles. So much that he would be crowned king. Not all enjoyed a
          kingdom and thus he was poioned. Unlike their plans though Garrad due to
          a not so normal dwarven cuisine built up a quite the tollerence. He instead
          turned sick for the longest of time.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Therese who grew up during this heard many stories of the companion of
          the hall and during her upbringing learned how to fight and battle dreaming
          of becoming an adventurer. Her dad though had other plans for her and insisted
          she would not become such a rebel like the dwarf king and that dark elf
          friend of his.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Despite her wishes Therese has mostly been abiding to her dad's wishes
          but also got her way own as she achieved quite the rank as corporal in
          the kings army.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Her father died during this time and she fell under the care of her sick
          uncle. However during her passing when she was going to be crowned as queen
          her ancestor Orvuisita Esseren showed up and claimed the throne. Therese
          who swore to never be noble and not to be queen was quite happy with these
          turn of events and instead swore her allgience to the queen.</p>
