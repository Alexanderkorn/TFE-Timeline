        </p>
        <p>Queen Orvuisita Esseren was born 174 DR in the city of Marabar by the
          second ruling lord of Marabar. During her childhood she was born during
          a time of war as the invasion of the drow was going on during her upbringing.
          More of a tomboy and wanting to prove her self to her father learned how
          to fight and weild a blade. At a young age of 16 she ran away from home
          and joined the war as a squire.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>During a decisive fight against the drow at Tyar-Besil she awakened her
          divine powers becoming a full fledged war cleric. With her newfound power
          and turning victiourius she quickly raised in her ranks. At the age of
          24 fighting in the underdark she met her father once more and was brought
          back to the surface to be crowned queen as her father was at the end of
          his life.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>She gladly accepted becoming queen and would after some time return to
          the war but at the depth of their progress sadly she lost her life at the
          age of 33 the year 207 DR.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>1495 DR She was reborn by her patreon Lathander at the dawn of a time
          where she would be needed once more. She returned to her kingdom finding
          out that the last bloodline of her family has ended and she was the last
          remaining Esseren left in the sword coast. She took upon the crown once
          more and find out about the upcomming threat of dragons and their cultists
          by the vision Lathander granted her upon her revival. Lathander during
          the vision told her the following.</p>
        <p>"I will bring you back into world of turmoil where fate hangs at the balance.
          You the last heir of Esseren shall fight the dragons of Tiamat and be a
          blockade to their troups. You shall wed a soldier who will save the world
          and then become king. When the kindom is once more safe you will once more
          pass at the end of a great war where your husband and children will carry
          on the line of Esseren."</p>
        <p>As the prohecy said she thought agaonst the cult of dragons and eventually
          met Baldrich who saved the world against the dragon godess Tiamat and saved
          the world.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The two have now spent the past 10 years to unite the sword coast under
          a kingdom once more and with the war going Esseren fears this is tha last
          leg of her journey.</p>
