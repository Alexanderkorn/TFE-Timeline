        </p>
        <p>Barthuc was born in the year 294 DR on the streets of Baldurs Gate. At
          a young age he was raised in an orphanage but unique as he is. He has always
          been a bit odd and a bit different. Not like the other kids who dreamed
          of being heroes or knights of a castle. When Barthuc grew up he kept to
          himself and read every single book he could find and was quite gifted in
          the arcane, quickly he learned to do things most teenagers could not do
          when he was still a kid. He never made any friends and was viewed as an
          oddball by the other kids as they often found him talking to himself or
          something else. This is because of a rare innate ability he was born with.
          Barthuc himself knew that the voices he heard were not fake or imaginary
          but were actual devils from the hells. Not knowing his parents and seemed
          to be born out of thin air, Barthuc reasoned that it might be related to
          his birth but never questioned it or looked into it like any normal person
          would do when they grew older.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><strong>Candlekeep</strong>
        </p>
        <p>As he grew into his teenage years his magic grew and became a bit more
          volatile and dangerous as Barthuc often experimented with his magic. Like
          any good wizard, you have to first learn it in theory and then form a hypothesis
          before you then try it practically. This is what he told the adults whenever
          he got into trouble at least but it still did not excuse him for using
          some of the bullies and mean people he encountered as involuntary test
          subjects.</p>
        <p>Once the adults had enough of the random imps that would show up in their
          storage stealing food and suplies showing up at random times, they eventually
          contacted Candlekeep so the wizards could take him away to school and maybe
          teach him some manners. However as Barthuc was before he still is now.
          The magic initate at Candlekeep often questioned the teachers and was nor
          particullary fond of the many rules of the school. Instead Barthuc believed
          in a more practical form of learning and continued his methods that worked
          from before and even at school. Despite being a rebel Barthuc still did
          not have many friends as often got into trouble which warded of most people
          from him. However he did make a few friends and it was not hard to as the
          Thayan was was at full swing which put Candlekeep at high alert getting
          a vast amount of students riled up.</p>
        <p>Some of the friends he made was a wizard named a evocation wizard named
          Lathar. A dragonborn named Balasar, A necromancer named Miriam and her
          teacher Vakan.</p>
        <p>One of the few guest teachers that frequented the school took a liking
          to Barthuc and aproved of their rumbuctious behaviour and even ecnouraged
          it. Miriam like Barthuc had a tendency to not really take rules or even
          laws into consideration and when the friend group heard about so called
          adventurers they wanted in on the action and decided to come together and
          promising they would be friends after they graduated. Each and every one
          of them vowed to become adventurers together. Barthuc not wanting to wait
          as usual being different from his peers had a plan and did things differently
          from what a normal person did.</p>
        <p>The year was 310 and Barthuc was 16 years old and was two years from graduation
          and it was a year since their promise. During the year Barthuc had spent
          even more time in the library and borrowed many of his fellow students
          book to sign them as part of a tradition among future collegues. What the
          teachers and students did not know that this was not a simple signature
          but each signature was an arcane symbol. Barthuc gifted as he is and possibly
          the best conjuration wizard the world have ever seen was experimenting
          with a new form of summoing magic. Thus when the time was in he left candlekeep
          on a scool trip to Dafferford. He camped outsdie the city and already having
          a magical storage item at the ready in a form of a small demi-plane, he
          conjured and stole every single book in the Candlekeep library. Including
          several copies and books that the other students had that he had signed.
          He then stored all the books inside of his demi-plane before he fled and
          decied to travel Faehrun for adventure and to avoid the many guards that
          would be after him. This is how Barthuc became one of the most wanted people
          in the continent of Faehrun. During his travel he found many other friends
          such as a dwarf from Mithral Hall named Noraba. A barbarian named Zia and
          a Fighter named Ehrrani.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><strong>The Pentharam</strong>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>These were the first members of Barthucs party named The Pentharam that
          would become much larger than what the wizard first planed. The group adventured
          for a long time and would later meet many iconic figure in sword coast
          and start to gain a reputation. You see considering who was in charge and
          the kind of company Barthuc hanged out with. You take this combined with
          how adventurers usually are and you can see why fame and infamy both circled
          around the group. One day they might slay an adult dragon. The next they
          accidently blew up a farm. The third day they took down a gang of bandits
          that happened to have some explosives hidden in a barn inside some hay
          that may or maybe not be caught on fire.</p>
        <p>The rest of the classmates fulfilled the vowed and with the new additions
          to the Pentharam made the group quite large. As the groups finally joined
          together the year 312 DR there would be some drama that would split the
          group into two. During the adventures of Barthuc and with the increasing
          threat of the Thayan war as they would march west towards Sword Coast had
          put some tension on several members. Barthuc wanted to prove to the world
          that they were the heroes of the story and not villains voted to fight
          in the war. Miriam who was a necromancer wanted to join him to prove that
          necromancers were not all evil. A few more joined while Vakan who left
          his job wanted to lead the rest and wanted nothing to do with Thay and
          the war. So the group split with one group going on adventurers like Barthuc
          did and carried on the name under new leadership. While the rest left the
          group to join the army.</p>
        <p>The Thayan war was a long bloody war with the land of Thay and their undead
          invading the south being one of the causes for the fields of the dead.
          Their forces was eventually pushed back and amongst the forces pushing
          him back was Barthuc. The once bratty childish rumbucious young adult finally
          grew some maturity after the war, seeing the horrors that the war could
          bring. Once Thay was oblterated he left the front his friends and despite
          winning the war and defeating the enemy. Barthuc did not feel a victor
          that day as they destoyed and entire land with everybody in it only leaving
          a few survivors. An event he had read a long time ago. Something that the
          elves during the third crown war has done they themselves have caused once
          more.On the way back the other group had made a friend with a gold dragon
          who had told them about their destiny to be one of the greatest party that
          the world would ever see. That is also when he revealed himself what he
          truly was. A golden dragon and fate keepr by the name of Tye'rhee. He told
          them about their fate and that is where the second part of Barthucs adventure
          starts.</p>
        <p>Once more The Pentharam would change as those chosen by Tye'rhee would
          leave and travel between the realms and across the astral sea for new ventures.
          Some stayed in Toril whie other followed Barthuc into his new adventure
          wanting to see the worlds beyond. Along they met many many friends. Like
          Alberichs and Octavius, Ardun and Tirona in Ravnica. Erhanis sisters in
          the fey wild. The void dragon Ezekel and many many more. They traveled
          across the word and once they had saved many lives they decided to return
          to Toril to check on things. However when they arrived back many years
          have passed. It was now the year 520 DR and a lot have changed. Tye'Rhee
          then revealed the true reason he took them was to return them here as it
          was their destiny to arrive back at this time during the second dragon
          war. The Pentharam once more saved the world and after they were done a
          lot of party members from other realms wanted to return to their own world.
          Tye'Rhee noded and The Pentharam once more left Toril and ventured through
          the realms with only a few remaing party members returning to Toril for
          some R&amp;R. However once more they would not return to their origianal
          time. Barthuc did not mind and left as he was just happy to be back. The
          year was now 1050 DR and Bartuc for a brief moment of time befrended mordenkainen
          and his group exchanging ideas and stories. It would also be the first
          time that Barthuc would break one of the wizards rule cloning himself to
          make him self young again. Once young again he went on a few adventurers
          with some of the eight and others before he would be summoned to Eberon
          by his friends there that wanted his help with a big war that would happen.</p>
        <p>Barthuc looked for Tye'Rhee and told him of the event and gathered his
          friends as they would arrive for one final adventure. This war was the
          so called 100 year of Eberron that would destroy the county of Cyre and
          end in climatic boom. Not to delve to much information there have been
          many incidents of drama within The Pentharam dating all the way back to
          the Thayan war. Once a faction gets larger different people are going to
          have different opinions. The solution to this has always been a divide
          and conquer tactics. There is an issue. You form two parties and you go
          with both outcomes for the maximum profit. A mindset that Barthuc secretly
          backed but Miriam was the frontier of. This worked for most issues. However
          not all disputes was solved in this matter. For example some people wanting
          to leave The Pentharam due to relationships is not something you should
          or can contain. This was the case with some of the seven siblings of Ehranni
          during their adventures in the fey wild as some decided to stay behind.
          <br>Before the 100 year was going on a lot of drama was bubbling up because
          of a certain issue with three unoficial leaders of the faction. The Pentharam
          was often lead by Barthuc, Tye'Rhee,Vakan, Miriam or Ezekel. Mosto ften
          those were in charge. However as Miriam and Barthuc had grown closer in
          later days so did Ezekel and Miriam as well and there would be a rivalry
          between the two. Where Miram and Tye'Rhee ended up in the crossfire between
          the two. This escalated and several members in The Pentharam was forced
          to take sides in who they would be "close friends with." Which is a state
          that was often used. In actuallity it meant that you are my close friends
          and loyal to me or you are working against me and is trying to undermine
          me.</p>
        <p>As The Pentharam was summoned to the 100 year war to help with a crisis
          when the faction it self was dealing with drama it self and somewhat of
          a crisis it did not help that they were thrown into a battle field. The
          100 year war was not mearly a war between a countries but The Pentharam
          it self splitted siding with different factions of Eberron it self and
          it turned into a civil war. Barthuc and some other wanting everybody to
          be on the same side was fighting a loosing battle and stayed netural while
          he saw his friends fight each other. During this conflict he would loose
          many friends and it would end in the worst way possible. Ezekel not gaining
          what he wanted or not wanting any part of the drama ended it with a coup.
          The circumstances is unclear of why or how things went down. All that is
          known is that Ezekel had a hand in the end of the war and the destruction
          of Cyre in one way or another. After that event The Pentharam was no more
          and everybody went their seperate ways, vanishing into becoming legends
          and myth across the multi-verse.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>During this time Barthuc the once leader of The Pentharam became reclusive
          and was not seen or heard from again for a long time. The wizard went back
          to his roots and delves into his studies prefering books over company.
          During his many years of isolation and studies he discovered something
          in one of the books. A different world that has been created by a person
          and not by a god. He has no clue who or what made this world but only that
          they refered themselves as the Architect and came from a world where magic
          worked completely different. Barthuc tried to make sense of what he learned
          and he found out a few things from the architect and the world he came
          from.
          <br>The architect is an ancient being from another world that fled an apocalypse
          of his people and the lands he came from and in turn to make his own demi-plane
          and continue to work on it through eternity to make it bigger and endless
          so it would last forever and would be an infinite plane of possibility.</p>
        <p>The architect was directly made by a god and was given almost equal powers
          and in comparison was as powerful as the Suracks from ancient Toril, the
          creators of the netherscrolls.
          <br>The world he came from did not have the weave and magic completely different
          from the multi-verse that Barthuc was part of.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Intruiged about this world and it's potental, Barthuc went to the endless
          as he would call it where he found a city that the Architect built as an
          outpost and explored it's secrets and inner workings. This wold be the
          start of project Arcadia and required an immense powersource and thus Barthucs
          last true adventure began as he went into research mode and worked on devises
          that acted as powersources in different ways. The Prime Matrix, Hell Engine,
          An Arch Heart, Dragons Core, Psionic Beacon, Celestial Star. Infernal Core,
          Cold Core, Necrosis, Fate Core, Elmental Burning Locust. and more.
          <br>All of this power sources either comes from a monster type or damage type.
          So the Hell Engine is based on fiends and uses an entity called the eternal
          flame which is a sentient fire fro mthe fourth layer of hell. While a Collapsing
          Star is a device that has a mintaur star at the end of it's life cycle
          but due to very high power magic casting time stop at a localised point.</p>
        <p>He then invited some of his closest friends being very careful who invited
          to the city and would help it take of into scy powered by one of these
          prototypes of power sources that gave Arcadia it's flight capability. The
          start of the Etharia Brewery and the last chapters of Barthuc's life.</p>
