        <p>In a region of the celtic land Unther inside the dragonborn city Djerad
          Thymar-Balasar Delmirev was born. The circumstances of his birth is a bit
          complicated and unconvential because he was born in the middle of the transportation
          of the city and being of uniquee blood and origin their parents had a weird
          experience during his conception. As he was being birthed time and space
          twisted and contorted as the city was being transported into a new world
          from Abeir to Toril. Due to this Balasar at a young age did not stay for
          long and is also not able to age. He was sent back into time to the year
          1112 DR. Newly born he was young but only in mind as his body had aged
          into an adult. Shortly after his magic would run rampart and cause wild
          magic to fluxuate and the grown child in the midst of confusion caused
          havoc where he would end up being placed. This wold be inside the land
          of Shou Lung. Being a born natural disaster he was eventually apprehended
          by powerful spell casters of the land and was brought in to justice.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Luckily for the dragonborn an advneturing group of Barthuc together with
          Noarabar and a few members of the eight were passing by and had heard about
          the weird dragonborn with it's wild magic going rampant decided to check
          it out. No clue what a Dragonborn was since they would uppear until much
          later came by and noticed the nature of magic. Barthuc examining Balasar
          found out that he was not a sorcerer and decided to quote "adopt" the dragonborn.
          Balasar as an adult and quick learner under his upbringing studied magic
          but not without hiccups as the afliction of wild magic was affecting the
          dragonborns magic and often caused accidents and some adventures along
          their way. Barthuc not really wanting to be a teacher and the same was
          said for Noarabar who was very much against the idea of Balasar coming
          with them in the first place was also not that suited to take care of the
          dragonborn. Despite Barthucs reluctance he decided to visit a old "friend"
          of his and went to Baldurs Gate where Ezkel was. Together they went to
          Ramizhan and had him tutor a new magician and agreeing to this the wizard
          teacher agreed in turn Ezekel and he would study the rare wild magic wizard.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Balasar would then pracitce magic and would be a contact to Barthuc and
          become somewhat of a close friend but left in the care of Ramizhan became
          quite closer to his teacher than Barthuc or Ezekel did. Balasar join their
          guild even and fell in love with Baldurs Gate. Growin fond of magic he
          also wanted to study in Candlekeep but was not allowed to by the two of
          them. At occation some other of Barthucs friends showed up and he took
          particular liking to Norabar despite the dwarves best effort to make it
          sure they would not become friends. Balasar thought it was a challange
          isntead and oftend found it to be a brotherly affection. The dragon born
          would cary on and eventually would be allowed restricted acess to travel
          so the dragonborn could learn more. Balasar though knew this day would
          come and one could argue that it was kidnapping. At least that is how Norabar
          saw it but Balasar ran away on a journey around the Sword Coast on what
          he would call a small adventure. Growing up and becoming more attuned with
          his magic Balasar would then solve this whole issue of not being allowed
          to be seen as a dragonborn since they were not meant to acess and instead
          on a jorney with some friends through the planes like Barthuc once have
          done. So he traveled before he would eventually return at a different point
          in time like he was taught by Ezekel and returned to Mithral Hall to visit
          his old friend that he still spend times with till this day. Norabar and
          Balasar in current days are still together in Mithral Hall. On occation
          Balsar travels to Baldurs Gater to visit his home he owns there and on
          other occations he goes to Mirabar where his other good friend Tristan
          is there. Because his relationship with Tristan he has gotten some connections
          to the royal family and some other important people in Mirabar.</p>
