        <p>Zia was born in the wilderness between Elturgard, Cormyr and Amn within
          her tribe. Her father was a woman goliath while his father was a human.
          It was a tribe of mixed races that lived of the land like in the oldern
          time from hunting and gathering. It was a small tribe that always stayed
          between 20 and 30 people. They were peacful and often traided in Elturgard
          at times and had a happy co-existence. At the fall of Elturgard their trade
          was shortlived and the tribe had to find new avenues. At first the tripe
          traveled south to Amn to maybe do some trade ain Eshputa but as they arrived
          they were greeted with hostility as they were treated as raiders and marauders.
          The clan instead left towards the north and was planning to traverse the
          mountains. As they arrived they quickly found them selved pinned between
          mountains and Amn as adventurers of Amn was hired to kill them off. Battle
          broke out and all but a few survived. Zia's father was one of the casualities.
          Some of them made it off and slank into the mountains. They knew how to
          fight and Zia was no difference. She however had other plans as she was
          filled with something she never had experienced before. A pure hatred and
          anger like that of fire as she grabbed her fathers axes and broke off from
          her tribe. The adventurers thinking this was a simple fight of taking out
          bandits did not expect them selves to be ambushed in the dead of night
          as Zia came on them like a whirlwind of anger and hatred as she killed
          the people resting. However as she looked around she noticed that only
          half of the 8 party members were at the camp. Panicked she tried to backtrack
          to find her tribe but it was to late. Once more her fury struck at the
          adventurers that had killed her tribe and her parents. When all was said
          and done at the edge of her own life she had survived but she was not yet
          done as she knew who was responisble for them being hired and her vengence
          was not yet sated.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><strong>The Butcher</strong>
        </p>
        <p>After her tribe died Zia went to her first city as she was never in charge
          of trade as she did not know how to read or write. However she did not
          come on friendly terms as she made it towards the barracks before she started
          fighting as she got her vengence before eventually she would be apprehended.
          She was then taken to Athkatla as she was put into prison. She would not
          stay for long though as she would stay there until she found a point that
          she broke free and just like the nickname she was given she broke free
          with fellow prisoners and broke free. After that she would be known "The
          Butcher of Amn" Together with the fellow prisoners she and her group become
          the thing that Amn fears as they beceme marauders pillaging and raiding
          the various cities, villages and town. With Zia as their right hand woman
          they were so prosperous that they expanded from Amn to the Eltugard in
          the north. Cormy to the north west all the way east to Hlondeth and Sspech
          and along the Lake of Steam.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><strong>Turn of Events</strong>
        </p>
        <p>After becomming a woman in her late 20's while raiding the now enterprise
          of marauders one day encountered a group of adventurers. None of them looks
          quite strong and as they attacked the group they would quickly learned
          that they were heavily outmatched. Zia though would not give up and took
          down two of them before she would be bested by a young looking wizard that
          bested her. She would not give up and to her surprise the group did not
          punish the marauders or took them to prison. Instead they taught them a
          lesson on who not mess with. Zia confused about this saw something she
          had not seen in a long long time. They reminded her of her old tribe and
          as they left she decided to take a longer look. She offered the tribe to
          spy on them and maybe find a new oppurtunity while in actuallity she would
          follow them and observe them. Till one day she was spotted by the young
          wizard and talked to him and after a long long discussion they ended things
          as friends.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><strong>Time of Adventures</strong>
        </p>
        <p>Together with the group Zia thought great beasts and saved the world a
          handful of times. She saw thing and places that no other of any tribe would
          ever in their life time experience. She enjoyed it immensily and had a
          blast. As time continued and the drama within the Pentharam grew bigger.
          Zia would take her leave departing from the group not wanting any part
          of it. Barthuc understood and asked where she wanted to go. She then asked
          Barthuc to be left at the Spine of the world as she has always heard about
          strong warriors there and so she would. For the next couple of years she
          would explore the north and prove her self a mighty warrior to the tribes
          of Uthguard. She joined one of their tribes as an honory members and learned
          to live in a tribe again sharing the lessons she learned from long before.</p>
