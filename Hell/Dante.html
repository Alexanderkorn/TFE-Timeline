        <p>Dante is the hellspawn between Zariel and Auriel but their history does
          not start there because Zariels was not always the leader of the hells
          army and Auriel was not always a Seraph. The time they had their kids was
          a time where Zariel roamed the material plane and wandered the realms patrol
          the border of hell. This is how he first met their mother. She was a woman
          from a different realm who was his nemesis. A champion of angels and thought
          against Zariel many times. However once adversary can at times be ones
          greatest allies when facing different a common threat.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>This is how the two met and fighting together they grew closer and eventually
          the two would have two kids. However Zariel breaking a taboo and so did
          their mother complicated things when things were said and done. The two
          seperated and was not seen together. On the way back Zariel got intercepted
          by Dispater. During that fight he loose both his kids as they ends up in
          the material plane.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Left in the material plane Dante was left at a orphanage but being a problematic
          rebelious kid, Dante had a hard time settling down and often ran away to
          go on his own adventurers.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>During his upbringing his father was brought to the hells to answer his
          actions to Asmodius. Zariel admitted his sins and then lied to the lord
          of lies as it was not completely true and not completely not true either.
          Dante's father told Asmodius that he had brought two children into the
          world . Neither was fully fiend and one day one of them would be the ruler
          of hells army against the demons and end the war once and for all. Asmodeus
          not believeing him but seeing the promise the two children could bring
          agreed on Zariels terms with some conditions. Zariel excpeted the deal
          and was then ordered to find a smith who would make the children two weapons
          sealed in disaster and destruction and immense power to bring the world
          to a still. Zariel confused agreed and knew the right enchanter and weapon
          maker for the test. Zariel who have talked with Barthuc many times before
          knew of his friend Ezekel and have even helped them in one of their previous
          encounters. It was time for Ezekel and their group to return the favour.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Dante later grew up and became a devil and demon hunter of Toril and started
          his humble career as a mercenary. During one of his first jobs to protect
          a caravan brought him into a great adventure which would eventually lead
          him into many annoying fights with dragons and against even the forces
          of hell itself. He would meet his other brother Vergil and defeat him as
          wel as the dragon godess Tiamat becoming close friend with the current
          king of the sword coast.</p>
