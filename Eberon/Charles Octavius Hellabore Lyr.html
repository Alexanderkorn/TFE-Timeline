        <p>Charles Octavius Hellabore Lyrriman d’Sivis-Master Arcanist-Head Scribe
          of Mror Holds-Lead Researcher in the Lbrary of Korranberg-Octavius the
          Purple in the Arcane Brother Head- Honory member of the 8/13-Current Member
          of The Pantharaam.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Octavius was born and raised in the land of Zilargo. As a relative to
          Lysse Lyrriman d’Sivis and a member of House Sivis Octavius had a comfortable
          life as nobility. His parents often spoled him as a only child and the
          vast family despite being a small side part provided him some security
          from the Trust faction.</p>
        <p>Like many gnomes and nobles in the land Octavius loved to read and was
          naturally a talent in the fields of the arcane as he was privately tutored
          by other arcanists of the land. He dove through book after book after book
          and becamse quite intruiged by the stories he read. However talented he
          was Octavius was not perfectly satisfied with his living conditions. The
          gnome knew he was being spoiled and at times broke of from his comfy home
          only to be taken back unwillingly. Octavious was also very facniated in
          fictional art while his family wanted and insisted he would become a historian.
          Octavious being very gifted as a historian though despised the proffession
          and was way more interested in adventures and a life away from home. It
          did not help that assassins from The Trust ran the country and was often
          a cause of worry and paranoia to the family. Because of this Octavius did
          not really trust in that many people and had no friends which was another
          thing his family disliked as they constantly insisted on the importance
          of connections.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>As Octavius had grown older and becoming of age he had a enough. "Enough
          is Enough!" The gnome blurted out and took his belongings and then took
          of running away from home to never be seen in a long time. His first destination
          was the ctiy of Sharn he had heard many stories about but never visited.
          Quite quickly though he learned that it was a city much of the same and
          even to a more of a extreme than he first thought. Greedy politicians exploiting
          the weak to fill their coffers while others suffers living comfy lives
          in their high towers. Disgusted Octavius instead headed to the north as
          he traveled to Breland and then to Droam, The Shadow Marches followed by
          the Elden Reaches where he met with many good friends. Like an elf by the
          name of Eliahna. He then went on his journey traveling east to Aundair
          and then Trane. He went into Cyre and then north to Karrnath before he
          crossed the Taenta Plains and lastly headed to Mror Holds which was his
          final destination. There he would meet one of his bestest and closest friend
          Alberich. Finding a place where he was free to think and read and mind
          his own business and also finishing his adventure the gnome settled down.
          This was until his next adventure would start.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>One day he was given a message from Eliahna in the Elden Reaches about
          an invitation to join her on a new adventurer. During the time of study
          Octavius have learned even more about the worlds and the different planes
          of existense. Even other material planes out there and then was invited
          to join in order to visit them. How could he refuse so he immidietly accepted
          and even invited Alberich. The dwarf was more hesitant of the travels but
          hearing that Octavius would leave despite him not joining disliked the
          idead of leaving his gnome friend behind and accepted the invitation to
          join after all. They talked of thwere to join and Octavius suggested they
          would join in Cyre but he would be a while since Octavius also wanted to
          visit Q'Barra and Valenar before heading to Cyre which the other part of
          the party agreed on. After some travles the two groups finally met at their
          meeting point and that is when Octavius would meet another person who would
          be one of his closest and bestest of friends Barthuc. For a long time the
          two groups did not leave right away. Mostly consisting of spell casters
          they set up a base of operation in the city as they all chipped in to establish
          a book club. Octavius was the one that chipped in the idea and Barthuc
          and Ezekel both agreed as the two quote on quote leaders of The Pantharam
          thought it was a wonderful idea. Thus the Lyrriman Bookclub was established
          and used as a guild hall for the Pantharaam in Cyre.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Once the less educated members of The Pantharaam grew to restless and
          the spellcasters were done discussing the party finally left and traveled
          the realms on the greatest adventure Octavius had ever seen. Traveling
          to the nine hells, The world of Ravnica, The Beast Lands, A world named
          Terra and saving people slaying beasts and even befriending dragons. The
          adventure lasted for a long time and during the trip some drama happened
          and the destination ended in the world of Toril. The home world of Barthuc
          that facinated Octavius. It was more primative to Eberron but the people
          there was far better in the gnomes opinion. Octavius then split of the
          group as he wanted to see the world for himself which Barthuc admired and
          allowed. Alberich was more hesitant to let his friend travel alone but
          distracted by hearing about the dwarven history and Mithral Hall relented.
          He also had heard about another dwarf that Barthuc knew of and wanted to
          meet this Norabar. Thus Octavius went on a long joruney across Faehrun
          on his own and explored this brand new world. For the longest of time Octavius
          was alone and explored and the world was so much larger than he expected
          him to be that he even declines another invite to travel still traveling
          to the edges of the world before he would finally relent during his second
          invite to return to Eberron. At this point Octavius had grown old and he
          started to miss Alberich and Barthuc and all other friends. That mixed
          with the concern in Barthucs voice pulled him back and gave him no doubt
          about the decision to return to the world he was from.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>As Octavius returned though he found out that a war was brewing in Eberron
          and concerned for his family and his home in Mror Hold accepted and came
          back to Eberron. When he was back he found out that all out war between
          the nations had errupted and many of his old friends were fighting on opposite
          sides. A lot of the tension was towards the land of Cyre and despite his
          love for his home in Mror Hold and book club in Cyre the two were on opposite
          side. He could either join Mror Hold and fight against Cyre and his friends
          or join Cyre protectiing what he and his friends had been building this
          entire time. Octavius chose to join Barthuc, Ezekel and Miriam in Cyre
          and try and solve things peacfully. Without knowing it, it was the smart
          move as Mror Hold rather than engaging in war became isolated and opted
          to not be in the war at all and instead close it's border and seclude it
          self from any conflict. Things did not end peacfully though as the war
          reached it's climax surrounding the floating captial and then with some
          involvement from Ezekel the city and land exploded taking out not just
          the countless lives but also shattering The Pentharaams Faction. Octavius
          and Barthuc both being experts in Conjuration came together and teleported
          everybody they could into safety. They all then went seperate ways.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Octavius not knowing what to say or do looked at his friends who at this
          point were either filled with hate, sorrow and resentment walking seperate
          ways leaving the old gnome behind. Octavius knew what Ezekel had done and
          why he did it. Sacrificing himself to become their enemy in order for them
          to stop killing eachother. The gnome though for a split second when the
          argument before the split was at it's peak was the highest could explain
          it. However would they listen? Would they be willing to forget and forgive?
          No. Stubborn as they are they would most likely not listen and instead
          do what he have seen so many do and be stuck in their ways of drama and
          self gain. Just like all the politicians, spies and people in power have
          done so when he was still young. Thus Octavius remained silent and instead
          slipped away like he did before as he returned to Mror Holds. There he
          accepted to have been marked an enemy but instead he was welcomed with
          warm hands and was given his potion at the library of Mror Holds as it
          caretaker. A position he welcomed and could calm his peaces...excpet it
          never did.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>After some time of studing the gnome would later come to start regretting
          his inaction to speak up and would never come of that desision again. Filled
          with sorrow and sadness, Octavius became more isolated and burried hiimself
          in the books around him. Alberich was the one and only friend remaining
          and despite many attemtps from Eliahna he never came back to visit her.
          However one day Bathuc reached out to him for some helpe and told him about
          a project he and Tye'Rhee have been working on. Something he called project
          Arcadia and asked for his help. Octavius accepted and then once more came
          to Barthucs aid on what would be his finaly journey. During the events
          in the Etharia Brewery Octavius defenced the flying city of Arcadia and
          after his death the group came to his funeral remembering that day they
          all treated eachother as enemy. Now when Octavius died he had done what
          he regretted not doing so long ago. To bring all of his old friends together
          and forget their old grudges. To come togheter and forgive one another
          and to move forward into a brighter new future.</p>
