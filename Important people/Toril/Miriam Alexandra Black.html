        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Miriam was born as a noble and was the first daughter of her elven mother
          and human father. She was born into wealth and luxory of the high nobles
          of the city due to her magically inclined paretns. Their father being a
          worshipper of Ioun and wizard of divinity. Their mother an accomplished
          sorcerer and sage to the king. They had a happy life and Miriam remember
          her childhood fondly as she often played with her human brother Lathar.
          Later in their years Lathar found himself blessed with the ability of magic
          from Ioun. Truly a blessing from the gods. Miriam on the other hand was
          not so luckily. As the two grew older they became more distant as Miriam
          had to study and work hard for her magic just like her father had to as
          she would eventually become a wizard like him. However it was a slow argues
          progress and she showed no talent for the arcane. For years and years no
          talent was shown from her. Due to the arcane practice Lathar lived on as
          he cheated death many times and used potions and magic by the netheril
          to extend his life. The siblings still loved eachother but it was nothing
          like their youth as a rift had formed between the two. Then after centuries
          the incident happened. One that all historian knows off as the fall of
          the cities happened. The two young ones survived while their parents sadly
          did not make it.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><strong>The Fall from Grace</strong>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>After the fall of Netheril, Miriam and Lathar went their seperate ways.
          Miriam went on a jorney around the sword coast and discovered the first
          signs of arcane magic she has been denief from during the past centuries.
          She deducted that during the fall the magic of Netheril must have been
          infused to her giving her the power she always wished for. It however happened
          at the expanse of her parents lives and thus she never wanted to use her
          magic. She instead took her smarts and studied and learned all there was
          to know of the world. She took a special interest in litterature and even
          wrote a few books such as "A maidens wish, Death allure, The Widows Kiss
          and more." All fictional roamance novels. Only the first being somewhat
          considered smut. She grew wealthy and became swiftly a famous writer and
          quite rich. Several suiters came for her hand but she had no interest in
          romance as they were all the same. No interest in her and all they care
          for was her fame and her wealth. One day when she was in the city of waterdeep
          she visited the city of the dead. Always having interest in the macabre
          and death she decided to have a look. There she found a person named Vakan.
          At first he did not mind the wizard and she instead wandered around looking
          at the graves and detecting the ghost she smiled at them as they gave her
          curtsey. This probably drew attention from the wizard as she spoke out
          to her and together the two conversed.</p>
        <p>At first the conversation was courteous as they talked about death and
          the poetry behind it. Vakan liked her books and took interest in the woman.
          Another suitor, Miriam would thing and gave him a cold expressions but
          to her surprise, the man took interest in the book subject rather than
          the romance part of them. As they continued the more engaged the two became
          and herself and Vakan spent a whole day and night talking and in the dead
          of night as Vakan brought up magic inviting her she stormed of. "Such talent
          should not be wasted on frivolous books and balls. It should be spend researching
          and mastering the arcane that I know you want to explore." The wizard pointed
          out to her. Furious she was about him presuming to know what she wanted.
          Angry she was that he thought he knew what would be best for her. Vakan
          though had a point as she wanted to learn more. With great reluctance she
          accepted his offer to come with as he would later take her to Candlekeep
          to learn more magic.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><strong>Candlekeep</strong>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>During her time in Candlekeep Miriam hated it with a passion. All of these
          young wizards and witches all causing commotions and turmoil with their
          gossip and their parties. How could anybody concentrate and their manners
          were the worst. However it was something she had to deal with. She was
          600 years old. Half of them in Netheril and half of them as a traveling
          noble. Still young and older than most half-elves would ever become. Another
          miracle from the Neheril magic she imagined to her self as she was walking
          to the library. As she arrived at the library she looked for the books
          she needed for her classes as she heard something from around a few book
          shelves. Soemthing that sounded like a chanting and to her surprise she
          saw a young wizard looking to be around 14 years old. What is he doing?
          She thinks to her as she watches him and then realises he is practicing
          his magic and realising this to late, trying to stop him turns him into
          a cat as his polymorph misfires. "You stupid man! Why the hell are you
          practicing magic in the library! What if something happened to the books!"
          She says quietly scorning the now cat that looks up at her curiously. Trying
          to stay mad, she fails as she would pick up the cat. "Lets get out of here
          before somebody notices us." She says to the cat as she takes his and her
          stuff both and scurries off before they get into trouble.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>This was the first time she met Barthuc. I could write many stories of
          the two of them. Their many study meetings. When they adventured together.
          When Barthuc fell in love with her. She was way older than him though and
          despite all her efforts as they studied more friends would join the fold
          such as a Balasar and later on her brother even. Together they spent a
          lot of time together doing what youths do. It was strange as Miriam used
          to hate people like Barthuc. He was impolite, foolish at times, never listened
          to somebody else and always did things his way. Despite all of his flaws
          she started to like him more and more, sadly she came to realise this to
          late as they soon graduated and become adventurers as the war against Thay
          would start. Barthuc now an adult and despite the age difference due to
          their races she could go for it and would be prime time to do so as she
          knows how short human lives can be. However they have more important things
          to do than that as the group of friends joined arms and became soldiers
          in a war.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><strong>The Pentharam</strong>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>After the war when it was all settled the adventures they all wanted to
          take woudl start as they made firends and traveled the world saving it
          against liches, dragons, elementals and so much more. Their numbers would
          grow and the group known as The Pentharam would form. It grew and grew
          as it became so big that it could not hold on it's own as drama eventually
          occured within the part and to Miriams gripe she would be the centre of
          it. It all started with Barthuc their leader clashing with Ezekel who would
          become another leader of the group. Just as she finally came in terms with
          her emotions another suitor would come in as Ezekel also grew fond of her
          and what made it worse is that she thinks that for a time he was the better
          option. Barthuc was young and way to different in their age range. He was
          after all over 500 years older than him. Ezekel was basically her own age
          but unlike Barthuc they did not have the same connection. They became friends
          as they both very much thought and liked the same things but something
          was missing from Ezekel that she had with Barthuc. What that was she never
          knew or learned. The thing that made it worse is that Eliahna. A good friend
          who was in love with Barthuc as well. This all together with difference
          in opinons on how to continue now that the group have become so big it
          could be it's own faction with 30 members caused quite some problems. Shorty
          after this would all break out even more as certain members including her
          self went to Eberron to side with those important people that were close
          to you.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><strong>Eberron</strong>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The 100 year was a tough time for Barthuc and Ezekel both as their friend
          Octavius was about to loose his whole family in this war. Barthuc, Ezekel
          and Alberich was there for support. During the war at the battle of Harrow
          Crows we were going to set up an outpost behind enemy line. However as
          we were planning and prepping we were not aware that Thrane was going to
          use it's lumber for their siege weapons as they were going to advance into
          Cyre and the two countries clashed. There a battle was thought as Barthuc
          was fighting against Verdh and Ezekel was battling against Lathar. That
          day something broke within Ezekel and maybe it did with Miriam as well
          as her beloved brother was killed by one who she loved deeply. At the end
          of the war when Cyre was attacked from all sides losing this war that raged
          for a 100 years, Ezekel took matters into his own hand unleashign unchecked
          magic and dooming the place. All but one survived as Miriam screamed and
          tried to stop him before he could. The next thing that happened once she
          woke up is that her appearance and soul had changed into that of a lich.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><strong>Aftermath</strong>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>As a lich all that love and romance in her life had left her. All that
          remained of her old elven self is just a never ending thirst of knowledge
          and power. Unlimited and uncontrolled power that only Vakan could give
          her so she could make sure that nothing like what happened that day would
          ever happen again. Using secret necromancy arts and magic that many deemed
          taboos she would split of her broken souls and souls taken from others
          so she can split her mind and body into different planes and realms making
          sure that wherever somebdoy was needing guidance or knowledge could find
          her. A painful experience that feels like death a 100 times and something
          she does and continue to do as she travels the multi-verse only leaving
          shadows of her true self remaining.</p>
