        <p>The Arcane Brotherhood was first formed a long time ago as a vanguard
          for the Sword Coast and it's people against evil out there. It was a esteemed
          brotherhood of mages and witches of the arcane arts that protected the
          realms from dangers like dragons and fiends. However with the betrayal
          of Haddar turning on Mordenkainen and the eight the previous esteemed faction
          fell to corruption and was less focused on protecting the realm and more
          so of protecting the city of Luskan. The city of Luskan is governed by
          noble houses that are reffered to as ships and is metaphorical term for
          the trade empires that they run across the sword coast as they don't only
          act inside the city but also outside it's city wall. With the Fall of Tiamat
          the Brotherhood is being restructured and rebuilt to it's former glory
          under the watchful eye of the king and his loyal close friends.</p>

        <p>The Emerald Conclave is a group of Druids, Rangers and nature loving people
          regarding class who work in unison to protect the smaller urban settlements
          across the sword coast. The focus in the protection of nature and the natural
          balance regardless of the origin and thus works sometimes against the law
          if it happens to be corrupt.</p>

        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The guild of Force Gray is a independant adventurer guild stationed in
          the city of Waterdeep. What sets it apart from the traditional guild is
          that they only allow spell casters to be able to join the guild with no
          exceptions. Graduates who wishes to adventure and dreams of things outside
          the schollar or serving the land often wishes to join this faction as it
          is highly sought after. At first the guild in it's younger days the guild
          only accepted spell casters of the arcane nature but in later days have
          accepted other classes like Druids and Clerics as well to join their ranks.
          In order to join you first have to undergo some tests to prove that you
          are an actuall spellcasting class of enough stature in order to be accepted
          as mearly having some spells from being a tiefling or having some items
          or being magic adept is not enough to get in.</p>

        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>For the longest time maybe even from the founding of Baldurs Gate the
          city have opted not to rely on the unified military of the sword coast
          and instead chosen it's own military system. The guards and military of
          Baldurs Gate is as much as a guild as it is an army with the benefits of
          being acting guards inside the city of Baldurs Gate. They accept any and
          all classes as long as you are good hearted and not thwarted by the usual
          illegality that most adventurers pocess. Only the truly lawful is allowed
          to be a member of the flaming fist and joining is even stricted than joining
          any other guilds. Joining is also not something you do a whim and can take
          years to be accepted into the folds of the guild. However once you are
          a member you are a member for life and will be one of the many proud soldiers
          of the Flaming Fist.</p>

        <p>The USA has the CIA, Russia has the KGB and Sweden has their Special Defence
          Unit.</p>
        <p>Any great nation requires it's own specialy trained agents who are willing
          to defend their world against foreign and internal threats and thus the
          harpers were created. Just like the previous mentioned it is a well known
          faction across the sword coast and to treat the harpers as mere spies is
          an understatement. Unlike the previously mentioned the harpers does not
          work according to poitic and does not have an allegience to any nation.
          They work as spies, soldiers and adventurers to defeat evil wherever it
          works and is the more traditional adventurers group in that they accept
          any and all classes no matter what your past may have been as long you
          are working for the greater good. Because of this though and the fact that
          members are treated as spies the general fold in Faehrun do not trust the
          harpers and is seldom inclined to shair their information with members.
          A harper never neads to tell anybody that they are a member to get what
          they need is a common phrace inside of the faction.</p>

        <p>The Lords alliance is and was the goverment of the sword coast for the
          longest of times. It is a faction made and formed by various nobility in
          the Sword Coast that are spread through out the land. Once a year they
          have a meeting where they discuss current affairs and they always work
          in the betterment of the sword coast. Every decision they made is made
          through vote and has a democratic system in place so that no city or place
          will be favored over another. They are the founders of the Unified military
          of the sword coast and work together in times of war to fight foreign nations.
          In peace time they work as sponsors for adventuring parties that go and
          do quests for the various nobles when dangerous threats are around. For
          example a noble could come to the faction and tell them about a close by
          beholder taking his citizens. The faction then make a quests for it that
          then adventurers pickup and gets a reward from. The reward is either given
          by the nobility himself or the faction as payment for the service. The
          reason that the faction is willing to pay is because a danger to one part
          of the sword coast could later become a problem to the realm. However most
          nobility pay the reward themselves cause when you have gathering of nobilities
          in a faction who are all looking for self interest it becomes political
          game and every time there is a unified kingdom it rocks this boat.</p>
        <p>Many of the members inside the faction is against having a monarchy as
          it disrupts their trade and the faction.</p>

        <p>The order of the gauntlet is best described as a knightly brotherhood.
          They are sworn protector of the realm and is specilised in fighting against
          undeads and fiends. As part of joining the order you swore an oath much
          like a paladin would but do not have to be a paladin to become a member.
          The order accept all classes to join their fault but mostly consists of
          Paladins, Fighters and Clerics. Much like knights they patrol the sword
          coast and travels from place to place. They even at times have knigtly
          duels against each other in order to increase in rank or prove their worth
          and valor inside the order. Unlike a knightly faction they must not ride
          horses nor wear plate armours and is free to do as they please when they
          are free. When they are not free they are ordered by a superior much like
          inside an army of what to do next and where to go. At times of war and
          turmoil and conflict they are recruited by the lord's alliance or the king
          to help. During times of monarchy it is tradition for the leader of the
          faction to swar allegience to the crown as the guild works independantly
          from the lord's alliance and is known to have a ongoing rivalry with the
          comfy snobs as the members call them.</p>

        <p>Location: Unknown (Neverwinter)</p>
        <p>Symbol: A dragons claw</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Talon is a faction of very strong solo adventurers that works to create
          peace among dragons. Their objective does not include evil dragons as they
          actively work aginast their objective. The faction also works very much
          in secret and is acutally called Softclaw in actuallity. Talon is the guild
          they go and mention to outsiders to identify themselves. Even it's own
          members does not know the factiosn true name and it is designed this way
          for the factions own safety. What the members do is very dangerous work
          as they are in fact dealing with dragons and this includes ancient dragons
          that they interact with.</p>
        <p>The highest members act directly with Ophala as their acting faction leader
          with only one excpetion who knows the true identity of the actual guild
          leader. Ophala has named him second as he and her mate works as a pair
          and couple alone to achieve their goals. The director as he is referred
          as is working on alternative ways to deal with the factions issues and
          works independandtly in his own way to achieve the laughin wyrms dream
          as he to share this dream.</p>

        <p>Symbol: A star with nine points</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>It's been almost a thousand years since the times of the eight with their
          legendary tales from Greyhawk, Dragon Lance and interplanar travles that
          Mordenkainen and his group of adventurers have done such a long time ago.
          Now though the previous members is but a memory and some of the key members
          of the old members are gone. Mordenkainen is in Borovia driven mad, Bigby
          is traveling that astral plane with some survivors, Tenzer has gone missing,
          Fristandia is somewhere inside or outside Candlekeep and who knows about
          the rest. Thus new members have formed and making it nine members in total.
          The group of spell casters comes together in times of great threats to
          the world to stop the end of everything. However in late times there have
          been no such threats and thus the members are minding their own business.</p>
