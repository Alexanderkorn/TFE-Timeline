        <p>The School of Lumiflection represents a sophisticated branch of arcane
          study, dedicated to mastering the manipulation of light in all its myriad
          forms. From the subtle glow of a candle to the brilliant radiance of the
          sun, Lumiflectors are adept at bending, reflecting, refracting, and shaping
          light for a variety of purposes.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <h2>Philosophy</h2>
        <p>Lumiflectors view light as more than just a physical phenomenon; to them,
          it embodies knowledge, purity, and power. The mastery of light, in their
          eyes, is akin to touching the fundamental essence of truth and perception.
          They also embrace the concept of shadow, seeing it as an integral counterpart
          to light, rather than an opposing force.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>

        </blockquote>
        <p>Refraction Mastery:</p>
        <blockquote>
          <p>Skilled in bending light to create illusions, render objects invisible,
            or distort appearances.</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>Spectrum Vision:</p>
        <blockquote>
          <p>A developed talent to see beyond the normal spectrum, perceiving ultraviolet
            and infrared light.</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>Shadowmancy:</p>
        <blockquote>
          <p>The art of controlling shadows, shaping them into various forms for espionage,
            defence, or attack.</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>Solar/Lunar Channeling:</p>
        <blockquote>

        <h2>Teaching and Learning</h2>
        <p>Lumiflection is taught in unique academies, often situated in locations
          with extraordinary lighting conditions. These academies are centres of
          learning where students engage in rituals involving mirrors, prisms, and
          crystals, which are also essential tools for their magical practices.</p>
