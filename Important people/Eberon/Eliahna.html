        <p>Eliahna is one of the seven ward from the feywild and one amongst seven
          sisters.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>At a young age Eliahna was always there for her sisters and protected
          them from the dangers of the feywild. Chasing away pixies, Fighting Nilbogs
          who made fun of them and made sure every single one of her sisters came
          home safe. She never saw her self as the leader but despite this could
          not help herself of being jealous of her sister Ehrahni who everybody went
          for with their problems and concerns. She was always there for her sisters
          so why did they all turn to her and she hated her self for theese feelings
          as she knows It's not like she made them choose her as their leader. At
          times she went to the king tree to talk about this problem but the tree
          that brought them to life never handed them the answer and instead gave
          them clues and hints on how to find the answer themselves. To this the
          king tree said to her. "Jealousy is nothing to be ashemd about. It is part
          of life and often hides once true feeling. Embrace it and confront it."
          <br>Wise words but no comfort as her heart still was left uneasy. Despite
          that she took the trees advice and confronted Ehrahni about it. However
          things go seldom your way when emotions runs wild and one thing lead to
          another as missunderstandings happened and the two sisters ended up fighting
          one another. Maybe she thought that she could prove that she was strong
          to be a leader. Maybe she wanted to prove that Ehrahni is not as strong
          as she is and maybe she just wanted to vent her frustration. The Paladin
          and her sister who was a fighter exchanged blows and with her powers with
          her fighitng saw victory but then Ehrahni did something unexpected. Her
          sister dropped her blade and took a fatal blow to her stomach as she then
          hugged her sisters who whispered something she will never forget.</p>
        <p>"If being a leader is so important for you then who I am to question that.
          You are my sister and I rather let you kill me than me having to hurt my
          beloved family."</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>With that said she drops her weapon regretting her action and since then
          she never questioned her ever again. Because of the incident they grew
          closer. They eventually grew up and while facing the councils she never
          left her side during some tought times and hopefully she was able to share
          her burden of leadership.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>When the split happened Eliahna went to Eberron as Ehrahni wanted to alone
          go to Toril. The reason she wanted to head there alone was so maybe she
          could become a leader as great as her sister. However instead she found
          herself in different circumstances. When she was in the Elden Reaches she
          met a traveling group of planar wanderer including a person named Barthuc.
          They became quite good friends and each of them shared stories with eachother
          and decided to become travel partners.</p>
        <p>Together they traveled across Khyber and she was even offered to be taken
          to other planes. However she and her sisters made a promiss and she was
          going to stay there until she was satisfied. Instead she offered them to
          be taken to the feywild which was accepted as the group went back to the
          fey and met her sisters there who were done with their travels and adventurers.
          At the same time most of her siblings was home visiting and that is when
          she found out that Ember and Eshahna had become a couple together. This
          hurt her a bit as she have had feelings for Ember earlier but never acknowledged
          them earler. She was taught that you should not be with your sister and
          took it litteraly and only now realised that was only if you were relatives
          by blood. Because of this some drama insued as she had found out that she
          herself was target of admiration and love by their traveling cleric.</p>
        <p>Flustered and blushing she turned down his advances and started feeling
          that feeling from such a time along ago and tried to leave without notice
          but Barthuc as intelligent as he was saw through her and tried to fix it.
          Things started to get even worse as opinions and experience differed. Eventually
          the party decided to leave before stuff got out of hand.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Eliahna went back to Eberron and continues traveling but got what she
          wanted eventually as she became a leading member in the Elden Reaches despite
          being a palladin and not a druid or a ranger. She took this role seriously
          and burried her self in the work that laid before her. Eventually war approcahed
          the horizon and orcs from the south approached the forest threatening the
          long lasting peace while elves and folk from the east also posed as a threat.
          Tension all across Khorvair rose until the 100 year long war finaly broke
          loose. She asked for her friends for help like that they have done to so
          many other worlds. What she did not know and expect that the party would
          be asked to help other members in Eberron and she like many others were
          fighting on opposite sides. Luckily she never had to face some of her close
          friends but she had heard that one of the members she made friends with
          had been felled. She was not there when the situation came to an end and
          instead took a distance and stayed away from all of that.</p>
