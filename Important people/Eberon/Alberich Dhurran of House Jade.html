        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Despite common belief and it's easy to believe that the dwarf has been
          in Eberron his entire life but Alberich is originally from the world of
          Terra.</p>
        <p>In the northern mountains of Scandia and Germania in the dwarven kingdoms
          Alberich was born into the Dhurran family. Alberich had a fairly common
          upbringing in his youth. He had friend and a good clan family that took
          care of him. Rather than mining like some dwarves he took a liking to exploring
          and at a young age started to train in fighting. Instead of mining he would
          secure the already existing mines and clear them from any monsters he would
          find.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>However one day he would find a strange mine not like the others. From
          the start he could tell that it was different as unlike normal mines the
          tunnel was smooth and showed no markings that tools have been used against
          the cave wall. What evern stranger was that it seemed like it was going
          on forever. Alberich expecting it to lead to a dungeon or a lair gathered
          his courage and went onwards. However what he found was not anything dangerous
          as he actually found a gateway into Eberron and as he was looking back
          he saw a dead end.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Alberich who just came out of the tunnel found no entrnace back to his
          old plane and had no choise but to continue. Alberich continued on his
          way and eventually made it out of the tunnel system to find Mror Hold in
          Eberron. However the dwarf would not discover to find friend as he was
          treated with suspision and people who did not belief his story when he
          tried to explain himself. Alberich might not have found a lair or a dungeon
          but he had found some combat as he was determined to show his iron. "Show
          me your Iron" or "Show me your Steel" Is a dwarven phrace and it means
          to challange somebody to a duel.</p>
        <p>So when Alberich said "Let me show you all my iron." It's a universal
          phrase to a challange. The dwarves of Mror Hold accepted the challange
          and battle would commense. The challange was to beat 10 of their best warriors
          and Alberich beat twice as many. He wanted to fight more but at that point
          he was ragged and exhausted. Not pleased Alberich later on challanged every
          house and every dwarf that said they were a fighter and all but one fight
          he won.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The fight he would loose was against the current king but despite defeat
          Alberich would learn a valuable lesson and come to find him self close
          to the king. The king taught him that battle is not always necessary and
          that staying ones blade is just as brave as swinging it. Alberich at the
          time disregarded his words but respected the king as defeat against another
          dwarf is nothing shameful in dwarven society and is actually a good way
          to find a friend. After all anybody willing to risk their life in a dual
          is a respectable warrior. One of the kings daughters took also a liking
          to Alberich and with the bet that Alberich and the king had made. Alberich
          would put away his blade and learn the craft which Alberich in his younger
          days would refuse and never agree to. His daughter showed him the rope
          and was quite angry at Alberich for certain reasons.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Like said earlier, Alberich at a young age refused to sit idle and do
          blacksmithing and would never dream to mine. The kings daughter Bhurihne
          was the kings personal smith and as Alberich lost his fight and would start
          to learn blacksmithing she was tasked in instructing him. She quickly found
          out that Alberich was a natural at the proffession and was furious as all
          of this time Alberich could have been making things rather than destroying
          things. He had squandered his talents according to her and despite her
          furious anger at him, Alberich could do nothing but find the whole situation
          amusing and her anger only stoked the flames in his heart as he always
          fancied such passionate women. Despite her best effort to distance herself
          from him he would continue his pursuit in his dwarven stubborned until
          the two would grow quite close. However as their relationship grew warmer
          Alberich would find a new companion in the form of Octavius.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Mror Holds always welcome strangers into their fold as guests for trade
          and their coin is always apreciated but as soon somebody talks about moving
          in and is to stay for longer than a month the city turn it's somewhat darker
          side. It's extemely hard to get a house as new houses has to be carved
          or restructured if you want to live in central Mror Hold. If you are to
          move into a neibhour hood you have to earn the respect ofyou neibhours
          or they will heckle you and try and force you to move out.So when this
          tiny gnome would show up and try and get a job and house in Mror Hold there
          was a lot of pushback. However this gnome miight be tiny and look frauk
          I can assure you that he might be tiny but he is mighty as he would cause
          quite a commotion as the gnome summoned elementals that kept showing up
          and would almost cause a small war against this small gnome. At first Alberich
          and the king would hate the gnome as he was considered a coward not fighting
          his own battles. The kings daughter however saw it differently and realised
          how the gnome must have traveled the world alone and saw his intelligence.
          The gnome instead got arrested and later employed to be the queens advisor.
          After some time the gnome came to be close to the royal house and Alberich
          as well.</p>
        <p>The two grew to become the bestest of friends eventually.</p>
        <p>Also when Octavius asked to go on an advnture across the realms Alberich
          naturally accepted as well so he could protect his friends. The two joined
          The Pentharaam and went on a long journet traveling with Ezekel, Ardun,
          Tirona, Tristan, Miriam, Melisandra, Norabar and many more. After they
          had enough they then later returned as the adventure would arrive at the
          doorstep to Mror Hold it self. Tensions between the nations had grown even
          more severe. Cyre's power expanded and threatened the other nations until
          war would break out. A war that would last 100 years. Octavius who had
          family in Zilargo, Friends in Cyre and home in Mror Hold was quite conflicted
          about the turn of events. However the king who wanted nothing to do with
          this war told that for those who wanted might go to their place to fight
          while Mror hold would be sealed and safe. Octavius did not see his family
          that close to him anymore sided with Cyre. Alberich said his fareweell
          to Octavius and wanted to follow and help but stubborn as dwarves are stayed
          behind in the city.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Once the war was over his bestest of friend was distraught and Octavius
          told him about the horrors of the war but also of the sacrifice that Ezekel
          has made making him self public enemy nr 1. A common foe to keep their
          friends from going at eachother throat and also ending the war once and
          for all bringing peace to the world. With everybody in The Pantharaam going
          their seperate ways a long time of peace spread before Barthuc once more
          called for the gnomes help in something called project Arcadia. Alberich
          regretted never coming with Octavius during the war and this time he insisted
          on following so he could keep his now much older friend safe.</p>
