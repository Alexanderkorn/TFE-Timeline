        <p>Drazzors Rebelion: Tales of Crowns</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>A long time ago there was a kingdom along the Sword Coast named Uthtower.
          When the first king died his twin sons came into power and due to that
          fact they needed two crowns for the two kings. They went to the local arch
          wizard Inierv that would make them two identical crowns with powerful magic
          in their separate ways. Each of them having powerful protection magic and
          none divination magic such as a permanent spell of non-detection. However
          the crowns true potential would only be revealed when two twins would bear
          the crowns. The years passed by and eventually the second orc war commenced
          as orcs invaded from the north. As the kingdom was once more in danger
          the kings went to Inierv for help as to their surprise they discovered
          that the arch wizard has turned himself into a lich. However Inierv decided
          to help them and in doings so rose the tide and created a massive tidal
          wave. A tsunami that destroyed the entire orc army as well drowning the
          entire army of the kingdom and everybody living in it, creating the Mere
          of Deadmen.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>After the kingdoms fall the crown was lost and there was to be no sign
          of what happened to the old kingdom or Inierv himself. Now two dragons
          by the name of Wezlum and Welzour seek the two crowns. For about a centuary
          or two the have made an alias by the name of Voaraghamanthar and has hired
          Alfarious tribe of lizardfolk and the cult of the dragon to find the second
          crown as they have already found one. Little do they know that Inierv placed
          a terrible curse on the crowns. If they were to find the crowns Inierv
          who is very much still alive could dominate the dragon under his will and
          control them both for whatever purpose he desires.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>It has been 10 years since the defeat of Tiamat. With the recent death
          of the hobgoblin king a bugbear by the name of Drazzor has rose to claim
          the title of king of liberations as he seeks to conquer the Sword Coast
          and claim rights and citizenship for all monster races, including goblins,
          lizardfolk and bugbears. His rebelion is in full swing and with the displeasure
          of the king and a kingdom an open rebelion have emerged in the Sword Coast
          as only the gods knows how it all will end as alliaced shifts and battles
          are thought.</p>

          he is a fate watcher and champion of the Ravenqueen. Carnus died once before
          but with the fate of the world laying in the parties hand she has deemed
          him the essential key in the conflict of the crowns. What Carnus does not
          know is that it's the very same goddess that cursed his folk for all eternity
          to not have a mind of their own and not have the ability to flight after
          their kin betrayed her a long time ago.</p>

          mind of their own. Cortex is one of these creations tasked with holding
          a vault of one of the not so famous wizards but perhaps the most important
          one. Durring the fall of Netheril not all flying fotresses and cities got
          destroyed as one city and five castles that was floating over the sea to
          west fled into a pocket dimension to one day return and retake the kingdom
          they once lost. Arcanist Valeer is the last remaining Netheree in the Sword
          Coast. Nobody knows where he is and when he will return but during one
          day he will return to the vault that he left Cortex to a guard and activate
          the beacon inside that will call back the Netherees that fled. Another
          conflict that will turn the tides and shape the Sword Coast anew.</p>
