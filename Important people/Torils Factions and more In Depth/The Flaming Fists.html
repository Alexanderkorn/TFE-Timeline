        <p>For the longest time maybe even from the founding of Baldurs Gate the
          city have opted not to rely on the unified military of the sword coast
          and instead chosen it's own military system. The guards and military of
          Baldurs Gate is as much as a guild as it is an army with the benefits of
          being acting guards inside the city of Baldurs Gate. They accept any and
          all classes as long as you are good hearted and not thwarted by the usual
          illegality that most adventurers pocess. Only the truly lawful is allowed
          to be a member of the flaming fist and joining is even stricted than joining
          any other guilds. Joining is also not something you do a whim and can take
          years to be accepted into the folds of the guild. However once you are
          a member you are a member for life and will be one of the many proud soldiers
          of the Flaming Fist.</p>
