       <h1 data-trilium-h1>The Seven Wards</h1>

      <div class="ck-content">
        <p>In the twilight between day and night during the everfledging shifting
          of coloured leaved in a grand oak at the edges of fey wild seven sisters
          were born with no parent nor ward inside the tree that brought them. Seven
          leaves of autum sprung alive not as driads but Eladrin elves born from
          fey magic and some might even say one of the great flowering that elves
          possesed. None of the sisters were related by blood but they all came from
          the same tree and thus treated each other as sisters and cared deeply for
          one another. They grew up under it's crown and called it the King Tree
          and maybe this was true or maybe they just liked the idea when they were
          young to be called princesses. The tree spoke to each and everyone of them
          like a father would to a child and tought them how to fight and survive.
          In turn the seven wards as the tree called them would protect the tree
          and care for it until it was time for them to leave theirs nests as fledlings
          and would explore the world beyond.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>As time changed so does the seasons and as winter came to their part of
          the feywild the king tree fell into a slumber and wilt away. The seven
          wards mourned the king tree and as their tears hit the soil beneath their
          naked feet it encased the tree in ice as it then start to glow and bloom
          like it was midsummer bestowing the seven wards with gifts and abilites
          that no normal elves have. They can talk with trees and beasts at will
          and they do not age. Each and every one of them was also given special
          gifts matching their personalities. Together the seven sisters traveled
          the feywild and together they adventured using what their father had taught
          them.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>1-There was Ehranni the fighter. Strong and confident, A leader and the
          one who looked over her sisters.</p>
        <p>2-There was Edhani the druid who were loving and the one who cared for
          her sisters.
          <br>3-There was Ehrennrei the alchemist who explored the lands and made remedies
          and potions for her kin.</p>
        <p>4-There was Eliahnna the Paladin who guarded the grove and protected the
          family.</p>
        <p>5-There was Edrhiin the astout who learned all there was to know about
          all around her to prepare her family what was to come.</p>
        <p>6-There was Eshahna who loved nature and later falls in love with her
          sister Ember.</p>
        <p>Ember was passionate and loves the art and lifter all her sisters spirits
          in time of need and late became a couple with Eshahna.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Together they explored the feywild and learned about the amazing and horrible
          things the realms offers to adventurers. They thought against beasts, monsters
          elementals and more in their travels and the last thing they discover would
          change their lives forever. As they eventually have travelled the fey wonder
          they arrived as civilisation with the courts. Something some of them took
          interest in but others took wary of. Together they explored the various
          courts but never staying longer than a week. On their journey they learned
          about other planes and that their fairly small world was getting bigger
          and bigger and even bigger. With such wide world and the different problems
          across the world they felt a responsibility to protect those who could
          not protect them selves and to scatter to gather information and then one
          day when they restless souls would be at peace and finish adventuring they
          will once more gather at the tree that brought them alive such a long time
          ago. They all swore an oath to eachother and afterwards all most of them
          scattered the multi-verse. After times some returned to the feywild to
          wait for their sisters to return and at times they came back but only for
          shorter times. The current year of 1506 there are 3 of them in the fey
          wild while the other continues to adventure to this day and who knows what
          the future holds.</p>
