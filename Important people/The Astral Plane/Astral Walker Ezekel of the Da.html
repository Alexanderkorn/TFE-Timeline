        <p>Ezekel has had many titles and names through out his current life and
          has a long lasting story starting the astral plane where he was born inside
          of a collapsing star formed by black holes in space and time at the edge
          between worlds and realms. They then feed from the gravitational force
          of the void until they are young enough to leave. Not all Void dragons
          are born this way as some are born in limbo and at the edges of space where
          there is encough void to bring life. For the longest time in a world where
          time holds no meaing Ezekel drifted through the astral plane and exlored
          the vastness of the world and as he grew into juvenile he was given the
          title of Astral Walked. During his journey he learned a lot and encountered
          astral dreadnaughts and countless of spell jammers. However his story would
          not kick of untill he reached adult hood and visited the world of Toril
          where he studied in Baldurs Gate under the guidance of Ramazith as he called
          there by fate or destiny which is where he would learn of magic and master
          it becoming a sorcerer. He did not study long under the arch mage but then
          again Ezekel did not long until he would master magic quite easily.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Ezekel then explored the realms and the various worlds of Eberron, Exandria,
          Ravnica and more. During his time he garnered even more arcane knowledge
          and grew ever more powerful. It was when he was in Eberron when he first
          met another prodgy in the arcane like himself by the name of Barthuc. Younger
          but much alike Ezekel himself not abiding by normal means and structures
          Barthuc was quite simillar to Ezekel in that way and because of it the
          two became quite close. He desided to follow the wizard in his company
          in their adventures but there was one thing that he lacked that the rest
          had which he did not.</p>
        <p>Void dragons finds things such as morals and ethics trivial matters and
          one thing that all Void Dragons lack, is empathy. Most void dragons becomes
          mad and insane in their lonely life in space but unlike them Ezekel took
          a facination in the way of mortals and their squabbles of right and wring.</p>
        <p>Ezekel always have kept a cool and level headed attitude to sitatuation
          and oftens favoured logic over emptions and become a reasnoable voise in
          the adventure group named The Pentharam. Often though when emotions were
          high he came out as cold hearted and soul less to his groups and in turn
          was often the core of disputes. One of the voises that spoke against him
          the most often was the Ehranni and her seven sisters of siblings of Eladrin
          elves It's not Ezekel were lacking in feelings as he often found himself
          annoyed and frustrated by their will to see reason in dire sitatuion. Despite
          the conflicts The Pentharam continued and at times splitting into two or
          even three groups at times. It also grew in size as Ezekel made many contacts
          such as Tirona, Balasar Delmirev Master of Stories, Tye'Rhee, Ardun, Octavius,
          Alberich, Vakan, Miriam, Tristan, Verdh, Zia and many more.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>One of his closests friends was named Lathar who he valued as highly as
          Barthuc him self and the two even formed their own adventure guild together.
          Their guild like Ezekel himself has also had many named in history as Ezekel
          could never decide on a name. At one time it was called the mages from
          the void. At one time it was Baldurs Arcane, Another time it was Lathars
          School of Arcane shortly named LSA. The funny parts about their meeting
          was that both Lathra and Ezekel had been students of Ramazith and when
          the first part of Barthucs adventures were done and said Ezekel together
          with Lathra met up with their old master and together the three were the
          founder of their guild.</p>
        <p>Ramazith like Ezekel both lacked some morals and did anything to take
          magic to the fullest no matter the consequenses. They did some things that
          would be considererd as evil which Lathra was more reluctant of and Barthuc
          was completely against. Barthuc disliked Ramazith and his methods immensily
          and was one of the few reastons Batrhuc was never part of his friends guiild.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>After many many adventures Ezekel was once summoned by Barthuc to join
          him in Eberron as their friends from there needed help in a war. This was
          during a time a lot of drama was brewing with The Pantharaam and Ezekel
          with his indifferent attitude was oil to a fire as it would spur the dislikes
          with different members. This reached it's apex during Eberrons 100 year
          war as Ezekel had a more severe method of dealing with the war and that
          was to leave it completely. Several members were not even from Eberron
          and from what Ezekel knew is that they have never been involved in politics
          before so it made no senes why they should paratake in the war at all.
          However three of their members who were deeply invested in the war were
          fighting against each other. Octavius siding with the flying city of Cyre
          as it was his home land and where his family lived. He had a wife and three
          children. He also had several relatives in Zilargo. Verdh who was siding
          with Thrane and then there was the hobgoblin Drakhal from Darguun.</p>
        <p>Lastly there was Alberich who were from Mror Holds where octavius studied
          and had his job as a librarian.</p>
        <p>All of these friends of Barthuc, Ezekel and the others were dirrectly
          involved in the war and the members of The Pentharam were forced to choose
          sides as the none of their friends budged seeing old friends as enemies.
          Barthuc dided with Cyre as it was the core of the proble, Ezekel and Miriam
          was stationed there as well trying to solve this all peacfully which rarely
          worked. Conflicts all over Khorvaire Eberron insued and the final straw
          that broke the camels back was when Lathar who sided with thrane died by
          his owns hands in the forest of Harrow crowns.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Ezekel seeing no end to the violance made a deal with an otherworldy entity
          and through an infernal bargain collapsed the core of the conflict which
          was Cyre and in turn ended the entire world. He saved all of his friends
          from killing eachother by becomming their villain. Thus the war ended and
          everybody went their seperate ways after that. Ezekel seeing everybody
          leave also left them behind. However still wanting to keep a tab on his
          friends and the world left a copy of himself behind to keep an eye on things
          before he went back to the Astral Plane.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>After the events of the war and by causing the destruction Ezekel tapped
          into the power of that event and would start forging two weapons for one
          of his friends he had named by the name of Zariel. Ezekel made rebellion
          and Yamato for Zariels kids repaying the favour and in turn got some information
          that Ezekel wished for. The dragon then helped form the current goverment
          of the trade federation in the astral plane and as time not really existing
          in the astral plane started gaining followers as he eventually became an
          ancient void dragon and then later would become a god of the void. The
          void existed for a long time but recently a god named it fell and did not
          even have followers in Toril and other world. Ezekel took the place of
          the old dead gods portfolio and gained god hood. While The Astral Walker
          Ezekel walks the material plane of Toril his true self has become Ezekel
          God of the Void. A title he does not refer himself as he prefers his oldest
          title of Astral Walker even though it's not technically correct anymore.</p>
